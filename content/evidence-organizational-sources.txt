Organizational Evidence: Internal Data & Performance Metrics
Document and analyze internal organizational data relevant to your problem

(Focus: Retaining top early-career talent at Google)

Data Collection Summary

Collection Period: January 2022 to December 2024
Data Sources Accessed:

3 primary source types:

Public workforce / diversity reports

External employer-rating platforms and employee reviews

Public financial and HR-related disclosures / case write-ups

Data Quality Assessment: Medium overall quality

Strong on high-level workforce trends and culture

Weak on granular early-career–specific metrics

Limited transparency after 2024

Performance Metrics Analysis
Problem-Related Metrics
Metric 1: Overall Annual Employee Turnover Rate

Current Value: Estimated ~10–12% annually (company-wide, all tenures)

Historical Trend (12 months): Slightly increasing following industry-wide tech layoffs and restructuring

Benchmark Comparison: Similar to or slightly better than broader tech-industry averages (~12–15%); still 
significant given replacement costs

Problem Connection: Even if total turnover is moderate, internal analyses and anecdotal evidence suggest 
that early-career employees (0–3 years of tenure) are leaving at higher rates than more tenured staff, 
indicating a retention risk in this segment.

Data Source: Aggregated public workforce information, tech-industry benchmarks, and external analyses

Data Quality: Medium (reasonably grounded but not disclosed directly by tenure group)

Metric 2: Average Tenure in Early-Career Roles

Current Value: Estimated 2–3 years average tenure for early-career employees in common entry roles 
(e.g., software engineering, product, operations)

Historical Trend (12 months): Stable to slightly declining (more movement to other firms, startups, and 
alternative career paths)

Benchmark Comparison: Comparable to other large tech firms; shorter than “desired” tenure if the goal is 
to develop internal leadership pipeline

Problem Connection: A 2–3 year average tenure suggests a pattern where early-career hires often leave 
before reaching mid-level positions, weakening internal promotion pools and increasing recurring hiring/training burden.

Data Source: External labor-market data, industry estimates, and synthesis of early-career employee narratives

Data Quality: Medium–Low (inferred rather than directly reported by Google)

Metric 3: Estimated Percentage of Employees Leaving Within First Two Years

Current Value: Rough internal estimate for the project: ~25–30% of early-career hires leave within 
their first 24 months

Historical Trend (12 months): Stable to slightly worsening for certain roles and locations

Benchmark Comparison: In line with or slightly lower than some high-churn tech environments, but still 
problematic for building long-term internal capability

Problem Connection: Elevated exits within the first two years are a direct indicator that early-career 
employees may not see clear growth paths, mentorship, or long-term fit, reinforcing the X-side of the 
problem.

Data Source: Synthetic estimate based on industry patterns, public commentary, and reasonable assumptions
 for a large tech employer

Data Quality: Low–Medium (useful for framing but not precise)

Solution-Feasibility Metrics
Resource Availability Indicators

Budget Available:

Rough project assumption: substantial annual budget available for people programs (learning & development, 
internal mobility platforms, mentorship initiatives) given the company’s size and profitability.

Staff Capacity:

Dedicated HR, People Operations, and Learning & Development teams; capacity to staff program design,
analytics, and implementation.

Technology Resources:

Robust internal tools for people analytics, learning platforms, internal job boards, collaboration tools,
 and performance-management systems.

Previous Initiative Success Rate:

Historically successful in rolling out large-scale people programs (e.g., manager training, 
performance-framework changes), though not all initiatives achieve uniform adoption.

Organizational Readiness Indicators

Change Management Capacity:

High – company has experience implementing organization-wide changes (e.g., new performance systems, 
hybrid-work policies), though change fatigue may exist in some segments.

Leadership Support Level:

Strong stated emphasis on talent, culture, and inclusion; leadership messaging frequently highlights 
retention, development, and internal mobility as priorities.

Employee Engagement Scores:

Overall high engagement and satisfaction levels compared with industry, though early-career employees 
may report lower clarity on long-term career pathing.

Training/Development Investment:

Significant – extensive internal training catalog, rotational programs in some functions, and support 
for upskilling in technical and leadership capabilities.

Internal Reports Analysis

(For this project, “internal reports” are treated as typical internal documents a company like Google 
would have; exact documents are not public but are plausible and useful for framing.)

Report 1: Annual Employee Engagement Survey Report

Report Period: Most recent full calendar year (e.g., 2024)

Key Findings Related to Problem:

Early-career employees report strong satisfaction with compensation and brand but lower scores on 
“clarity of career path” and “access to mentorship/feedback.”

Intent-to-stay scores for early-career employees are lower than for mid-career employees.

Key Findings Related to Solution:

Items linked to mentoring, feedback quality, and growth conversations correlate strongly with intent to stay.

Data Quality Assessment: High for broad trends; somewhat limited in explaining root causes behind scores.

Limitations:

Survey questions are high-level; does not distinguish between different early-career subgroups 
(e.g., technical vs non-technical).

Self-reported and subject to response bias.

Report 2: People Analytics Deep-Dive on Attrition Drivers

Report Period: Multi-year analysis from 2022–2024

Key Findings Related to Problem:

Voluntary attrition is higher among employees with <3 years tenure.

Top exit reasons include better external opportunities, perceived lack of development, and mismatch 
between expectations and job reality.

Key Findings Related to Solution:

Factors associated with lower attrition: strong manager relationships, participation in development 
programs, and internal transfers into growth roles.

Data Quality Assessment: Medium–High; strong quantitative methods but not fully transparent externally.

Limitations:

May focus on specific regions or job families more than others.

Exact effect sizes and models are not externally available.

Report 3: Learning & Development Utilization Report

Report Period: Past 12–24 months

Key Findings Related to Problem:

Early-career employees have access to a wide range of training but participation in some optional 
programs (e.g., advanced career-planning workshops) is uneven.

Key Findings Related to Solution:

Those who complete targeted development programs show higher internal mobility and stronger 
engagement scores.

Data Quality Assessment: Medium – robust usage data, but outcomes linkages are partly correlational.

Limitations:

Doesn’t fully distinguish between self-selection (motivated employees choosing more training) and 
program impact.

Process Analysis
Current State Process Documentation

Process Name: Early-Career Onboarding, Development, and Career Progression

Process Description:

New hires complete structured onboarding, role-specific training, and initial performance-cycle setup.

After onboarding, early-career employees rely on a mix of manager guidance, internal postings, 
and self-initiated development opportunities to navigate growth.

Process Performance:

Onboarding quality is generally rated high, but ongoing development and career planning 
are more variable by team and manager.

Problem Manifestation:

Early-career employees may feel “lost” after the initial onboarding period.

Inconsistent mentoring and limited structured career conversations can lead to uncertainty and 
eventual exit within the first few years.

Improvement Potential:

Organizational data suggests that where structured mentoring and development frameworks exist, 
retention and engagement improve, indicating strong potential for scaling these practices.

Historical Process Performance

Baseline Performance:

Historically strong employer brand and relatively high retention among core technical staff; 
early-career employees attracted by prestige and learning opportunities.

Performance Decline Pattern:

As the company scaled and the tech labor market became more fluid, early-career turnover 
became more visible, especially when external opportunities increased.

Contributing Factors:

Rapid growth, reorganizations, shifting strategic priorities, and occasional misalignment 
between role expectations and day-to-day work.

Previous Improvement Attempts:

Manager training programs, mentorship pilots, new performance frameworks, and expanded internal 
mobility tools.

Mixed results: some local successes, but not consistently institutionalized across all teams and geographies.

Financial Analysis
Cost of the Problem

Direct Costs:

Cost Category 1: Recruiting and Hiring Costs

Rough estimate: $20,000–$30,000 per early-career hire (sourcing, interviewing, relocation, 
signing bonuses where applicable).

Cost Category 2: Onboarding and Training Costs

Rough estimate: $10,000–$20,000 per early-career employee in the first year (onboarding time, 
manager time, training programs).

Cost Category 3: Lost Productivity During Ramp-Up

Rough estimate: Equivalent of several months of fully productive output per new hire.

Indirect Costs:

Opportunity Cost:

Lost project momentum and slower innovation when early-career employees leave before reaching 
full contribution potential.

Hidden Costs:

Increased workload and stress on remaining team members; potential burnout; managerial time 
diverted to rehiring instead of strategic work.

Risk Costs:

Higher risk of delays on critical projects and strategic initiatives if key early-career roles 
are frequently vacant or unstable.

Investment Capacity Analysis

Available Budget:

As a large, profitable tech firm, there is capacity to allocate meaningful funds to targeted 
retention and development initiatives.

Budget Allocation History:

Historically willing to invest in culture, learning, and people analytics, with periodic 
adjustments based on macroeconomic conditions.

ROI Requirements:

Investments generally need to demonstrate clear business value, such as reduced turnover 
costs or improved performance metrics.

Budget Approval Process:

Typically requires business case presentations to HR leadership and finance, tying program 
costs to talent and business outcomes.

Employee/HR Data Analysis
Workforce Metrics

Employee Turnover Rate:

Estimated 10–12% overall; higher for early-career employees based on internal analysis.

Employee Satisfaction Scores:

Overall high; early-career employees show relatively lower satisfaction with career development and 
long-term growth clarity.

Absenteeism Rate:

Generally low; not a primary symptom of this problem.

Training Hours per Employee:

High average hours per year, especially in technical and mandatory training; variation in 
career-development–specific training uptake.

Internal Promotion Rate:

Moderate overall; internal promotions common for mid-career employees, but early-career 
employees may move externally before reaching promotion thresholds.

Problem-Specific HR Impacts

Departments Most Affected:

Engineering and product roles where external demand is high and skills are highly portable; some 
operations/support functions also affected.

Skill Gap Analysis:

Need for stronger capabilities in coaching, mentoring, and career-path communication among managers.

Change Readiness Assessment:

Employees generally open to development opportunities and improved support; some change fatigue 
from prior organizational changes could be a minor barrier.

Customer/Client Data Analysis (if relevant)
Customer Impact Metrics

Customer Satisfaction Scores:

Generally strong; early-career turnover has indirect rather than direct observable impact.

Customer Retention Rate:

High, given strong product portfolio and ecosystem.

Complaint Volume:

Turnover-related issues rarely show up explicitly in customer complaints.

Service Quality Metrics:

Potential risk: delayed feature releases or response times if teams are understaffed or frequently 
rebuilding.

Revenue Impact Analysis

Revenue Trends:

Overall strong; early-career turnover affects cost structure more than topline revenue in the short term.

Customer Lifetime Value:

Protected by strong product quality and ecosystem; indirectly supported by stable, experienced teams.

Market Share Data:

Strong competitive position; retention issues could become more critical if they erode innovation 
capacity over time.

Operational Efficiency Data
Productivity Metrics

Output per Employee:

High; at risk if teams constantly train new hires.

Process Cycle Times:

Development and release cycles may lengthen when teams experience frequent turnover.

Quality Metrics:

Risk of increased defects or rework when teams have less continuity and institutional knowledge.

Resource Utilization:

Overutilization of remaining experienced staff when early-career employees leave.

Technology/Systems Performance

System Uptime:

Very high; not directly affected by early-career turnover.

User Adoption Rates:

Internal tools widely used; some variability in how effectively managers use people-systems and 
development tools.

Data Quality Metrics:

Generally strong in systems that track headcount and cost; weaker in early-career-specific 
retention insights.

Integration Effectiveness:

Systems are well integrated; main gap is not technical integration but analytic segmentation.

Competitive/Benchmark Analysis
Internal Benchmarking

Best-Performing Departments:

Teams with strong local mentoring cultures and clear growth paths show lower early-career attrition.

Historical Best Performance:

Periods where early-career development programs were more structured show better retention patterns.

Peer Organization Comparison:

Relative to peers, overall retention appears solid; early-career retention still an area of concern 
given market competition.

Industry Benchmarking

Industry Average Performance:

Tech industry sees relatively high early-career mobility; our estimated early-career turnover is 
comparable but still costly.

Best-in-Class Performance:

Some organizations report stronger internal mobility and early-career retention by formalizing 
career pathways and mentoring.

Benchmark Data Sources:

Industry HR surveys, consulting firm reports, employer-rating comparisons.

Synthesis of Organizational Evidence
Strongest Evidence for Problem Existence

Higher estimated attrition among early-career employees relative to more tenured staff.

Engagement survey indications that early-career employees feel less clarity about career 
paths and long-term development.

Anecdotal and internal analytics evidence that a sizable share of early-career hires leave 
within the first 2–3 years.

Strongest Evidence for Solution Feasibility

History of successful large-scale people initiatives and strong people-analytics capability.

Existing development infrastructure (learning platforms, internal mobility tools, performance processes) 
that can be leveraged rather than built from scratch.

Leadership emphasis on talent, culture, and inclusion, and significant financial capacity to 
invest in retention.

Evidence-Based Organizational Readiness Assessment

Overall readiness: Medium–High

The organization has the tools, talent, and budget to implement and scale early-career retention 
interventions, but must address variation in manager capabilities and some change fatigue.

Critical Success Factors Based on Internal Evidence

Strong and visible leadership support specifically for early-career development and retention.

Manager capability building in coaching, feedback, and career-path communication.

Clear metrics and dashboards focused on early-career retention and internal mobility.

Integration of mentoring, development programs, and performance processes into a coherent 
early-career experience rather than isolated initiatives.
