# Success Criteria Definition
# Define specific, measurable criteria to evaluate solution effectiveness

## SMART Success Criteria

### Criterion 1: 
Specific: Increase retention of early-career employees (0–5 years experience).

Measurable: Improve 2-year retention rate from 60% to at least 75%.

Achievable: With mentorship programs, development plans, and recognition initiatives, this is realistic.

Relevant: Directly addresses the core issue of losing top talent early.

Time-bound: Measured annually, with first milestone after 12 months.

### Criterion 2: 
Specific: Improve employee engagement survey scores for early-career employees.

Measurable: Raise engagement scores from current 68% favorable to 80% favorable.

Achievable: Through feedback loops, growth opportunities, and improved communication.

Relevant: Engagement is a leading indicator of retention.

Time-bound: Measured every 6 months.

### Criterion 3: Internal Promotions from Early-Career Talent
Specific: Increase number of early-career employees promoted into mid-level roles.

Measurable: Achieve 25% increase in promotions within 2 years.

Achievable: With clearer career paths and leadership development initiatives.

Relevant: Shows retention is producing growth opportunities.

Time-bound: Tracked annually over 24 months.

## Measurement Framework

### Quantitative Metrics
Retention rate (12, 24, and 36 months post-hire)

Engagement survey scores (semiannual)

Number of promotions from early-career to mid-level positions

Training participation rates (% of employees enrolled and completing programs)

Recruitment cost reduction (% decrease in hiring/onboarding costs)

### Qualitative Indicators
Positive feedback from exit interviews (reduced reports of “lack of growth” as departure reason)

Increased perception of career opportunities (via pulse surveys)

Stronger mentorship relationships (measured via feedback forms)

Improved manager-employee communication quality

### Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

#### Leading Indicators 
Training participation rates, mentorship engagement, pulse survey feedback, number of career development conversations.

#### Lagging Indicators 
Actual retention rate, promotion rates, recruitment cost reductions.

## Baseline Measurements
Retention Rate (2-year): 60%

Engagement Score: 68% favorable

Internal Promotions (early-career to mid-level): 15% annually

### Data Collection Plan
HRIS system tracking retention, promotions, and turnover reasons.

Semiannual engagement surveys (with early-career subgroup analysis).

Exit interview data collection and analysis.

Training/mentorship program completion records.

## Success Thresholds

### Minimum Acceptable Improvement
5% increase in retention within 12 months.

### Target Performance Level
15% increase in retention and engagement within 24 months.

### Stretch Goal
20%+ increase in retention with significantly improved promotion rates (>30% increase).

## Stakeholder-Specific Success Criteria

### Management Success Measures
Lower recruitment costs, stronger leadership pipeline, retention KPIs met.

### Employee Success Measures
Clear career paths, access to mentorship, higher satisfaction.

### Customer Success Measures
More consistent service delivery, fewer disruptions from turnover.

## Risk Indicators


### Red Flags
Engagement scores remain flat or decline.

Exit interviews continue to cite “lack of growth” as top reason for leaving.

Mentorship program participation below 50%.
### Mitigation Triggers
Adjust program resources if participation lags.

Introduce new feedback mechanisms if engagement does not improve.

Revisit manager training if turnover remains unchanged after 12 months.

## Timeline for Assessment

### Short-term (30-90 days)
Launch mentorship and career development initiatives, achieve at least 50% participation.

### Medium-term (3-6 months)
First pulse survey shows +5% improvement in engagement.

### Long-term (6-12 months)
Retention rate increases by 5–10%, promotion pipeline improves measurably.

## Reporting Framework


### Dashboard Metrics
Retention, engagement, promotions, cost savings, training participation.

### Regular Reports
Quarterly HR reports to management and stakeholders.

### Milestone Reviews
6-month and 12-month reviews, followed by annual evaluations tied to HR strategy and budget planning.
