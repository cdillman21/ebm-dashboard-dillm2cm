## Access and Permissions

### Data Access Strategy
#### Required Permissions
- **Data Custodians:** 
  - HRIS Data: VP of People Operations and HRIS Manager
  - Financial Data: CFO and HR Finance Manager  
  - Survey Data: Director of Employee Experience
  - Performance Data: VP of Talent Management
  
- **Approval Process:** 
  - Submit formal data request form to HR leadership
  - Sign data use agreement specifying confidentiality and use restrictions
  - Obtain IRB-equivalent approval from HR Ethics Committee for any employee surveys
  - De-identification protocol approval for any data shared externally
  
- **Privacy Considerations:** 
  - All personal identifiers (names, employee IDs) to be removed or encrypted
  - Aggregate data only for small groups (<10 employees) to prevent re-identification
  - Comply with company data privacy policy and any applicable laws (GDPR if global employees)
  
- **Confidentiality Requirements:** 
  - Sign NDA covering proprietary compensation data
  - Limit sharing to project team and approved stakeholders only
  - No external publication without explicit written approval
  - Destroy or return data upon project completion

#### Contact Plan
1. **Primary Contact:** Sarah Chen, VP of People Operations (sarah.chen@company.com)
   - **Data Sources:** HRIS (Workday), turnover reports, organizational structure
   - **Approach:** Email request with project overview and specific data needs, followed by 30-minute 
   meeting to discuss access parameters
   
2. **Secondary Contact:** Michael Torres, Director of Compensation & Benefits (m.torres@company.com)
   - **Data Sources:** Compensation data, market benchmarking, benefits utilization
   - **Approach:** Referral from Sarah Chen, formal data request specifying aggregation level needed
   
3. **Tertiary Contact:** Jennifer Williams, Director of Employee Experience (jwilliams@company.com)
   - **Data Sources:** Engagement survey results, exit interview database, pulse surveys
   - **Approach:** Request access to filtered data (early-career cohort only), offer to analyze data 
   on-site if needed for privacy

### Ethical Considerations
- **Employee Privacy:** De-identify all individual-level data; use employee cohorts (n≥10) for reporting;
 no names or direct quotes without consent
- **Data Security:** Store all data on encrypted, password-protected devices; use company-approved secure
 file sharing; no personal devices
- **Use Limitations:** Data used solely for retention improvement project; not for individual performance 
decisions or disciplinary actions
- **Reporting Boundaries:** Internal reports only share aggregate trends; external sharing (if any) 
requires legal and HR approval; no compensation details shared outside project team

## Data Analysis Plan

### Baseline Establishment
#### Pre-Problem Baselines
- **Historical Turnover (2019-2021):** Establish pre-pandemic baseline early-career turnover rate
- **Compensation Growth:** 3-year average annual increase rate before current retention issues emerged
- **Engagement Scores:** 2019-2020 satisfaction scores as "healthy state" benchmark

#### Normal Operating Ranges
- **Acceptable turnover:** 8-12% annual voluntary turnover for early-career employees (based on industry
 benchmarks)
- **Engagement threshold:** ≥3.8 out of 5.0 on satisfaction items indicates healthy engagement
- **Compensation competitiveness:** 0.95-1.10 ratio to market median (within 10% of market)

#### Benchmark Comparisons
- **External:** Compare to BLS JOLTS quits rate for professional/business services sector
- **Internal:** Compare early-career turnover to company-wide turnover
- **Industry:** Compare to tech industry benchmarks (SHRM, Radford, Mercer surveys)
- **Peer companies:** Glassdoor ratings and published diversity reports from competitors

### Problem Evidence Analysis
#### Problem Indicators
- **Primary:** Early-career turnover rate >15% annually (above acceptable range)
- **Secondary:** Satisfaction scores <3.5 among 0-3 year tenure employees
- **Tertiary:** Compensation ratio <0.95 (below market) OR pay growth <3% annually
- **Confirming:** Exit interview themes showing compensation/development as top reasons

#### Problem Severity Measurement
- **Financial Impact:** (# early-career departures) × (avg replacement cost) = Total cost
- **Strategic Impact:** % of high-performer departures, critical role vacancies, knowledge loss
- **Trend Severity:** Year-over-year increase in early-career turnover (accelerating problem)

#### Root Cause Investigation
- **Correlation Analysis:** Turnover rate vs. compensation competitiveness ratio by department
- **Cohort Analysis:** Survival curves showing at what tenure point employees are most likely to leave
- **Text Analysis:** Exit interview theme coding for most frequent reasons
- **Comparative Analysis:** Departments with high vs. low turnover - what differs in comp, manager 
quality, development?

### Solution Feasibility Analysis
#### Resource Assessment
- **Budget Availability:** Current comp budget headroom for market adjustments
- **Cost of Inaction:** Annual loss from turnover vs. cost to close compensation gaps
- **Investment Capacity:** Training budget available for manager development programs
- **ROI Threshold:** If retention improves by X%, investment pays for itself in Y months

#### Capability Assessment
- **HRIS Capabilities:** Can Workday track and report on new metrics needed for monitoring?
- **Manager Readiness:** What % of managers have completed training? Capacity for more training?
- **HR Staffing:** Do we have dedicated resources to implement and sustain solutions?
- **Program Infrastructure:** Do we have learning platforms, mentorship systems, career frameworks in place?

#### Risk Assessment
- **Compensation Compression Risk:** Raising early-career pay without adjusting mid-career = equity issues
- **Budget Sustainability:** Can we maintain higher comp/benefits long-term or only one-time fixes?
- **Unintended Consequences:** Could enhanced benefits/development attract job-hoppers vs. loyal employees?
- **Manager Resistance:** Will managers embrace new development responsibilities or see as burden?

## Documentation Strategy

### Data Collection Log
- **Spreadsheet Tracker:** Date collected, data source, contact person, date range, sample size, 
completeness (%, any gaps)
- **Version Naming:** OrganizationalData_v1_2025-11-20.xlsx (version number + date)
- **Notes Column:** Document any anomalies, missing data, or quality concerns flagged during collection

### Analysis Documentation
- **Analysis Scripts:** R or Python code for data cleaning, aggregation, statistical tests
- **Assumptions Log:** Document all assumptions (e.g., "Regrettable turnover = top 2 performance ratings +
 voluntary separation")
- **Decision Log:** Record key analytical choices (e.g., "Excluded 2020 data due to pandemic anomaly")
- **Visualization Library:** Save all charts/graphs with metadata (data source, date created, filters 
applied)

### Quality Assurance
- **Cross-Check:** Compare HRIS totals to payroll system for headcount validation
- **Spot Check:** Manually review 10% random sample of records for data entry errors
- **Reconciliation:** Monthly turnover totals should sum to annual total (check for double-counting)
- **Peer Review:** Have second analyst review calculations and methodology

### Version Control
- **Git Repository:** Use version control for all analysis code
- **Dated Snapshots:** Save data extracts with extraction date in filename
- **Change Log:** Maintain document tracking all updates to datasets or analysis approach
- **Final Version Freeze:** Lock final dataset and clearly label for reproducibility

## Expected Challenges

### Data Availability
- **Challenge:** Exit interview data incomplete - only 60-70% of departing employees complete them
  - **Impact:** May miss important departure reasons from non-responders
  - **Mitigation:** Supplement with manager exit notes; compare completers vs. non-completers for bias
  
- **Challenge:** Compensation data for external market may be outdated (annual survey cycle)
  - **Impact:** Competitiveness ratios may not reflect real-time market
  - **Mitigation:** Supplement with BLS ECI quarterly data and real-time Glassdoor salary data

### Data Quality Issues
- **Challenge:** Performance ratings may have grade inflation or inconsistency across managers
  - **Impact:** "Regrettable turnover" metric may be imprecise
  - **Mitigation:** Use forced distribution guidelines if available; validate with manager survey
  
- **Challenge:** HRIS tenure calculation may not account for internal transfers correctly
  - **Impact:** Employees who changed roles may be misclassified
  - **Mitigation:** Manual review of complex cases; use "time in current level" vs. "total company tenure"

### Access Barriers
- **Challenge:** Compensation data highly sensitive - may only get aggregated/masked data
  - **Impact:** Cannot do individual-level regression analysis
  - **Mitigation:** Work with role-level averages and cohorts; sufficient for most analyses
  
- **Challenge:** Legal/privacy review may delay data access by 2-4 weeks
  - **Impact:** Project timeline compression
  - **Mitigation:** Submit requests early; prepare detailed data use justification upfront

### Time Constraints
- **Challenge:** Annual engagement survey only conducted once per year (already passed)
  - **Impact:** No new satisfaction data until next cycle
  - **Mitigation:** Use historical data; propose pulse surveys for more frequent monitoring
  
- **Challenge:** Data extraction from Workday requires IT support (3-5 day turnaround)
  - **Impact:** Iterative analysis slowed by extraction delays
  - **Mitigation:** Request comprehensive initial extraction; learn self-service reporting tools

## Backup Plans

**If HRIS Access Denied:**
- Use publicly available diversity/workforce reports (if company publishes them)
- Survey managers directly for anonymous department-level turnover estimates
- Leverage HR business partner knowledge through structured interviews

**If Compensation Data Unavailable:**
- Use external benchmarks (BLS, Glassdoor, Payscale) to estimate internal positioning
- Focus analysis on engagement scores and exit interview themes rather than pay levels
- Propose compensation audit as separate follow-up project

**If Survey Data Insufficient:**
- Conduct targeted pulse survey of current early-career employees (if budget allows)
- Use Glassdoor reviews as proxy for employee sentiment
- Structured interviews with retained vs. departed employees' managers for qualitative insights

**If Timeline Too Short for Full Analysis:**
- Prioritize descriptive statistics (turnover rates, averages) over complex modeling
- Focus on 1-year snapshot rather than 3-year trends
- Present preliminary findings with caveat about limitations; propose phase 2 deeper analysis
