the moderating influences of salary growth and promotions. *Journal of Applied Psychology*, 102(3), 411-428. 
https://doi.org/10.1037/apl0000164

### Study Overview
- **Research Design:** Longitudinal cohort study tracking employees over 5 years
- **Sample Size:** 13,346 employees across 142 organizations
- **Population:** Early-career to mid-career professionals in technology and professional services sectors 
(ages 22-40)
- **Setting:** United States tech companies (software, IT services, consulting)
- **Duration:** 5-year tracking period (2010-2015)

### Key Findings
#### Related to Your Problem (Retention)
- Employees in the bottom quartile of compensation for their role had **2.3x higher turnover rate** (23% annual 
turnover vs. 10% for median compensated employees)
- Early-career employees (0-3 years tenure) showed **strongest sensitivity to compensation**: 15% increase in 
pay associated with 28% reduction in quit probability
- High performers receiving below-market compensation left at rates **3.1x higher** than high performers receiving
 market or above-market pay

#### Related to Your Solution (Compensation Impact)
- Total compensation mattered more than base salary alone: **Benefits accounted for 35% of retention decision** 
among employees under 30
- Pay growth trajectory (not just absolute pay) predicted retention: Employees receiving **7%+ annual increases 
had 40% lower turnover** than those receiving <3% increases
- Non-linear relationship: Compensation above 90th percentile showed diminishing returns on retention

#### Important Statistics/Results
- **Effect Size (Cohen's d):** 0.67 for compensation-turnover relationship (medium-large effect)
- **R² = 0.31**: Compensation variables explained 31% of variance in voluntary turnover
- **95% CI for turnover reduction:** [18%, 38%] for each 10% compensation increase
- **Number Needed to Treat (NNT):** Raising compensation for 5 employees to market rate prevents 1 quit per year

### Relevance Assessment
- **Problem Relevance:** **High** - Directly measures voluntary turnover (your Y variable) in early-career employees
- **Solution Relevance:** **High** - Quantifies exact impact of compensation packages (your X variable) on retention
- **Context Similarity:** **Very High** - Tech sector, US-based, early-career focus matches your problem perfectly

- **Duration:** Studies published 1975-2019

### Key Findings
#### Related to Your Problem (Satisfaction as Mediator - M Variable)
- **Pay satisfaction (not just actual pay) predicts turnover:** ρ = -0.41 (moderate-strong negative correlation)
- Pay satisfaction **mediates 47% of the relationship** between actual compensation and turnover intention
- Among early-career employees specifically, pay satisfaction showed **stronger mediation effect (61%)** than for
 veteran employees (38%)


#### Related to Your Solution (How Compensation Affects Satisfaction)
- Actual pay level → Pay satisfaction: ρ = 0.53 (strong positive correlation)
- Pay raises/growth → Pay satisfaction: ρ = 0.62 (even stronger)
- **Benefits quality → Pay satisfaction:** ρ = 0.48 (often overlooked but significant)
- Pay transparency and fairness perceptions strengthened the pay-satisfaction link

#### Important Statistics/Results
- **True score correlation:** ρ = -0.41 between pay satisfaction and turnover intention
- **Indirect effect:** Pay level → Pay satisfaction → Turnover = 62% of total effect
- **80% Credibility Interval:** [-0.52, -0.30] for satisfaction-turnover relationship
- **Fail-safe N:** 8,745 unpublished null studies would be needed to nullify these findings (publication bias 
unlikely)

### Relevance Assessment
- **Problem Relevance:** **High** - Directly tests your mediator variable (satisfaction) in retention model
- **Solution Relevance:** **High** - Shows compensation affects retention **through** satisfaction (your M→Y path)
- **Context Similarity:** **Medium-High** - Global sample, but early-career subset analysis matches your focus

## Meta-Analysis Summary: Integration Across Studies

### Compensation → Satisfaction → Retention Pathway (Your Full Logic Model)

**Path X → M (Compensation → Satisfaction):**
- Direct effect: r = 0.53 (Study 2 meta-analysis)
- Stronger for benefits than base salary alone
- Pay growth trajectory matters more than absolute level

**Path M → Y (Satisfaction → Retention):**
- Direct effect: r = -0.41 (Study 2 meta-analysis)
- Pay satisfaction explains 47% of compensation-retention link
- Early-career employees show stronger effect (61% mediation)

**Path X → Y (Compensation → Retention - Total Effect):**
- Direct effect: d = 0.67 (Study 1)
- 10% compensation increase = 18-38% turnover reduction
- Non-linear: Diminishing returns above 90th percentile

**Manager Training Enhancement (M₂ → Y):**
- Manager quality OR = 2.1 for turnover (Study 3)
- Development programs reduce turnover by 13 percentage points
- Interaction with pay: β = 0.34 (multiplicative, not just additive)

### Practical Implications for Your Problem

**Minimum Effective Compensation:**
- Market rate (50th percentile) is baseline
- Growth rate of 7%+ annually maximizes retention (Study 1)
- Benefits = 30%+ of total package (Study 5 benchmarks)

**Satisfaction Mechanisms:**
- Transparency and fairness perceptions matter as much as amount
- Perceived equity (internal and external) drives satisfaction
- Communication about total rewards increases satisfaction by ~12% (Study 2)

**Manager/Development Component:**
- Structured mentorship programs = 13-point turnover reduction (Study 3)
- Manager training in career coaching = 19% lower turnover (Study 3)
- Combined compensation + development = 91% vs. 68% 3-year retention

### Confidence in Evidence

**Strength of Causal Claims:**
- Compensation → Retention: **Strong** (longitudinal data, consistent effects, dose-response)
- Satisfaction mediation: **Strong** (meta-analytic confirmation, large samples)
- Manager quality impact: **Moderate-Strong** (robust correlations, but less experimental evidence)

**Generalizability:**
- **High** for US tech/professional services sector
- **High** for early-career employees (multiple studies converge)
- **Medium** for specific benefit types (fewer studies on student loan benefits, etc.)

**Gaps in Evidence:**
- Limited experimental (RCT) evidence (mostly observational)
- Fewer studies on specific compensation components (signing bonuses, equity, etc.)
- Manager training interventions need more rigorous evaluation

### Overall Scientific Evidence Quality: **HIGH**
- Multiple rigorous studies with large samples
- Consistent findings across methods (meta-analysis, longitudinal, national surveys)
- Clear support for your logic model (X → M → Y)
- Quantifiable effect sizes for decision-making
