## Research Question
**Primary Research Question:** 

Does competitive compensation (including benefits and career development) increase retention of early-career employees through improved job satisfaction and manager quality?

**Specific Sub-Questions:**
1. What compensation level and growth rate minimizes voluntary turnover among employees with 0-5 years tenure?
2. How does job satisfaction mediate the relationship between compensation and retention?
3. What role does manager training/development play in retention beyond compensation alone?
4. What specific compensation components (base pay, benefits, equity, development) have strongest retention effects?

**Secondary Research Question:** 

What evidence-based compensation strategies have proven most effective for retaining early-career talent in professional/technical roles?

## Challenges and Limitations

### Search Limitations
- **Database Access:** Limited to university library subscriptions; 4 relevant studies behind paywalls with 
no working paper version (excluded)
- **Gray Literature:** Did not search unpublished dissertations or conference proceedings (may miss recent findings)
- **Publication Bias:** Studies with null results less likely to be published (mitigated by including meta-analyses
 with fail-safe N calculations)
- **Recency:** Studies published in 2024-2025 may not yet be indexed in all databases

### Resource Constraints
- **Time:** 2-week search window limited depth of citation tracking
- **Language:** English-only may miss relevant international studies
- **Expertise:** Solo researcher (no second coder for reliability checks on inclusion decisions)

### Topic-Specific Challenges
- **Compensation Confidentiality:** Many organizations don't publish detailed compensation data, 
limiting real-world case studies
- **Early-Career Definition:** Studies vary in defining "early career" (0-2 years vs. 0-5 years vs. age<30)
- **Causality:** Most studies are observational; very few experimental manipulations of compensation 
(ethical/practical constraints)
- **Mediator Measurement:** Satisfaction measured at same time as turnover in many studies (temporal ambiguity)
- **Industry Specificity:** Tech sector emphasis may limit generalizability to other professional sectors

### Mitigation Strategies
- Prioritized meta-analyses to address publication bias
- Used government data (JOLTS, ECI) to supplement peer-reviewed studies with authoritative benchmarks
- Focused on longitudinal designs when possible to strengthen causal inference
- Documented all inclusion/exclusion decisions for transparency
- Acknowledged limitations explicitly in evidence appraisal
