# Stakeholder Evidence: Quality Assessment
# Evaluate the credibility and usefulness of stakeholder evidence collected

## Overall Evidence Quality Assessment

### Data Collection Quality

#### Sample Representativeness
- **Target Population:** Global workforce (Gallup: 140+ countries, millions of employees); U.S. workforce (Conference Board: 1,500 workers, SHRM: 1,400 employees)
- **Sample Size:** External benchmark surveys (not internal stakeholder surveys—using published industry data)
- **Response Rate:** Not applicable (using published survey data from authoritative sources)
- **Representativeness Score:** High for global/U.S. workforce trends; Medium for our specific organization

**Rationale for External Benchmarks:**
This stakeholder evidence uses external benchmark surveys (Gallup State of Global Workplace 2025, Conference Board 
Job Satisfaction Survey 2023, SHRM Employee Satisfaction Survey 2024) rather than internal stakeholder surveys.
 These represent millions of employee, manager, and HR leader voices globally and provide authoritative validation
  of retention challenges and solution priorities identified in our logic model.

**Stakeholder Group Coverage (from external surveys):**
- **Employees (early-career and overall workforce):** Gallup global (millions), Conference Board (1,500 U.S.), 
SHRM (1,400 U.S.)
- **Managers:** Gallup manager engagement subsample (27% engaged, largest decline in young managers)
- **HR/Organizational Leaders:** SHRM survey includes HR professional perspectives (71% report difficulty retaining
 early-career talent)
- **Missing: Our organization's internal stakeholders** (internal surveys not yet conducted per evidence-stakeholder
-methods.txt plan)

**Representativeness Strengths:**
- Large, probability-based samples from gold-standard survey organizations
- Multi-country (Gallup), U.S. representative (Conference Board, SHRM)
- Stratified by industry, organization size, demographics
- Continuous tracking (not one-time snapshots)

**Representativeness Limitations:**
- External benchmarks may not perfectly match our organization's specific industry, size, culture, geography
- National/global averages obscure organizational variation
- Survey timing (Gallup 2024, Conference Board 2023, SHRM 2024) may not capture most recent micro-trends
- No direct voice from OUR employees, managers, leaders—generalized stakeholder perspectives only

#### Response Quality Indicators

**Survey Data Quality (External Benchmarks):**
- **Complete responses:** Not disclosed by survey organizations (proprietary methodology)
- **Survey rigor:** Gallup uses validated Q12 instrument (α>0.90), Conference Board and SHRM use established 
satisfaction scales
- **Sampling methodology:** Probability sampling (Gallup, Conference Board) or stratified quota sampling (SHRM)—all
 use scientific sampling, not convenience samples
- **Data quality controls:** Professional survey organizations with quality assurance protocols (skip logic validation,
 outlier screening, weighting for non-response)

**Limitations of External Survey Data Quality:**
- Cannot assess individual survey completion rates (data not publicly released)
- Cannot verify specific questions asked beyond summary statistics published
- Cannot control for survey fatigue across multiple employer surveys (respondents may be over-surveyed)
- Proprietary methodologies limit full transparency

**Overall Data Quality Assessment:** High quality for intended purpose (external benchmarking and validation). 
Surveys conducted by reputable organizations (Gallup, Conference Board, SHRM) with established methodologies and 
large representative samples. However, cannot assess granular quality indicators (completion rates, skip patterns) 
without access to raw data.

### Bias Assessment

#### Selection Bias
**Risk Level:** Low-Medium for external benchmark surveys

**Sampling Approach:**
- **Gallup:** Probability sampling across 140+ countries (low selection bias within sampled populations)
- **Conference Board:** Random sampling of 1,500 U.S. workers (low selection bias)
- **SHRM:** Stratified sampling by industry, org size, role (low selection bias)

**Self-Selection Issues:**
- **Voluntary participation:** All surveys require voluntary participation (some self-selection bias inevitable)
- **Non-response characteristics:** Survey organizations weight for non-response, but potential bias if disengaged 
employees less likely to respond (could underestimate dissatisfaction)
- **Potential bias direction:** If most disengaged/dissatisfied employees skip surveys, external benchmarks may 
underestimate retention crisis (conservative bias—our problem may be worse than benchmarks suggest)

**Organizational Selection:**
- Gallup and SHRM include all industries; Conference Board skews professional/white-collar
- All U.S. surveys exclude very small employers (<10 employees) and self-employed
- No surveys specifically target early-career employees exclusively (ages 22-30 subset, not primary sample)

**Overall Selection Bias Assessment:** Low risk for general workforce trends. Moderate risk that external benchmarks
 don't perfectly represent our specific population (early-career, professional roles, our industry). Conservative
  bias likely (underestimating dissatisfaction) is acceptable—better than overestimating problem.

#### Response Bias

**Social Desirability Bias:**
- **Risk assessment:** Medium risk for external surveys
- **Evidence of bias:** Employee engagement surveys prone to social desirability (employees may inflate satisfaction
 if employer can identify them). Gallup and SHRM use anonymous surveys to mitigate, but residual bias likely.
- **Mitigation used (by survey orgs):** Anonymity, third-party administration (Gallup, Conference Board independent),
 validated scales with lie-detector questions
- **Direction of bias:** If present, would inflate engagement/satisfaction (make problems look less severe than reality). 
Again, conservative bias—our interventions may be more needed than benchmarks suggest.

**Acquiescence Bias:**
- **Pattern of agreement:** Professional survey organizations design questions to avoid acquiescence 
(mix positive and negative valence, use forced-choice formats)
- **Question design assessment:** Gallup Q12 is validated instrument designed to minimize acquiescence. 
Conference Board and SHRM use Likert scales with balanced anchors.
- **Overall risk:** Low—survey instruments validated to reduce acquiescence

**Recency/Availability Bias:**
- **Recent events influence:** Gallup 2024 data collected during post-pandemic labor market shift (elevated quits, 
hybrid work adoption, economic uncertainty). May capture "new normal" or temporary disruption.
- **Typical vs. exceptional circumstances:** 2023-2024 labor market has returned closer to pre-pandemic norms (quit 
rates declined from 2021-2022 peak). Likely represents current baseline, not exceptional period.
- **Overall risk:** Low—current labor market conditions are relevant to our decision context (2024-2025 
implementation)

#### Confirmation Bias (Our Own Use of External Data)
- **Data selection neutrality:** Used major authoritative survey sources (Gallup, Conference Board, SHRM)—not 
cherry-picked obscure sources supporting our hypothesis
- **Data interpretation objectivity:** External surveys show both supportive findings (compensation #1 driver, 
manager quality critical) AND challenging findings (only 21% engaged globally—suggests interventions face headwinds)
- **Disconfirming evidence attention:** Noted areas where external data creates uncertainty (wide compensation 
percentile ranges, some organizations unsuccessful per Patel's 10% program discontinuation rate)

**Overall confirmation bias risk:** Low-Medium. Using established authoritative sources reduces cherry-picking 
risk. However, could have sourced surveys showing retention less problematic (e.g., industries with low turnover). 
Acknowledge we selected surveys validating problem/solution fit to our logic model.

### Response Consistency Analysis

#### Within-Survey Consistency
**Gallup Internal Consistency:**
- Employee engagement (21%) and manager engagement (27%) both low—consistent story of disengagement crisis
- Manager attribution (70% of team engagement) aligns with manager engagement decline—logical coherence
- Wellbeing (33% thriving) correlates with engagement (21%)—expected relationship

**Conference Board Internal Consistency:**
- Overall satisfaction (62.3%) higher than compensation satisfaction (46.5%)—logical (people somewhat satisfied 
overall
 despite pay dissatisfaction)
- Compensation (46.5%) and advancement (48.2%) satisfaction both low—coherent early-career retention risk profile
- Early-career subset (ages 25-34) shows 15-20 point lower satisfaction than older workers across multiple 
dimensions—consistent pattern

**SHRM Internal Consistency:**
- Top 3 turnover drivers (compensation 63%, career development 54%, manager 47%) align with top importance 
ratings—logical consistency
- Satisfaction gaps (72% say comp important, only 45% satisfied)—identifies priority areas coherently
- Manager training gap (68% say important, only 38% of orgs provide training)—consistent implementation barrier 
story

**Overall Within-Survey Consistency:** High. Each survey shows internally coherent patterns. No contradictions
 within single survey source.

#### Across-Survey Consistency  
**High Consensus Topics (All 3 surveys agree):**
1. **Compensation dissatisfaction is widespread** - Conference Board 42% wage satisfaction, Gallup engagement 
includes "paid appropriately" (low), SHRM 63% cite as turnover driver
2. **Manager quality significantly impacts retention** - Gallup 70% attribution, SHRM 47% cite as turnover driver,
 Conference Board 62% supervisor satisfaction (higher than comp but still 38% dissatisfied)
3. **Early-career workers at higher turnover risk** - Conference Board ages 25-34 less satisfied, SHRM early-career
 more sensitive to manager issues, Gallup young managers disengaged
4. **Career development gap exists** - Conference Board 48% advancement satisfaction, SHRM 54% cite career 
development as turnover driver
5. **Low overall employee engagement/satisfaction** - Gallup 21% engaged, Conference Board 62% satisfied (38% not), 
SHRM data shows majority citing dissatisfaction drivers

**Moderate Consensus Topics (2 of 3 surveys align):**
1. **Manager quality matters MORE than compensation** - Gallup emphasizes (70% attribution), Conference Board 
shows higher supervisor satisfaction than comp satisfaction, SHRM lists comp #1 but manager #3 (both matter)
   - Reconciliation: Compensation necessary, manager quality amplifies—aligned with our X→M→Y model
2. **Wellbeing/thriving declining** - Gallup 33% thriving (down from 35%), Conference Board shows declining 
satisfaction trend (not quantified in summary)
   - Reconciliation: Post-pandemic fatigue, economic uncertainty contributing to lower wellbeing

**Low Consensus / Divergence:**
1. **Absolute satisfaction levels** - Conference Board 62% overall satisfaction seems high vs. Gallup 21% 
engagement seems low
   - Reconciliation: Different constructs (satisfaction vs. engagement) and scales. Engagement is higher bar
    than satisfaction. Not contradictory—can be "satisfied" but not "engaged."

**Overall Across-Survey Consistency:** High on core findings (compensation, manager quality, early-career risk, 
development gaps). Minor divergence on absolute levels explained by construct differences. Strong triangulation.

#### Method Consistency (Survey vs. Qualitative in Original Surveys)
**Not Applicable** - External benchmark surveys are quantitative only. Our evidence set does not include 
qualitative stakeholder interviews from OUR organization yet (per evidence-stakeholder-methods.txt plan, 
internal stakeholder engagement not yet conducted).

**Implication:** External survey data provides quantitative stakeholder perspectives. Missing: Qualitative
 depth, organization-specific nuances, implementation preferences. Internal stakeholder engagement (per methods plan)
  would add qualitative validation.

### Credibility Assessment by Stakeholder Group

#### Employee (Workforce) Input
**Credibility Score:** High

**Strengths:**
- **Direct experience authenticity:** Surveys capture actual employee perspectives on compensation satisfaction 
(42-46%), engagement (21%), turnover drivers (63% compensation)
- **Large sample sizes:** Millions (Gallup), 1,400-1,500 (Conference Board, SHRM) employees represented
- **Representative sampling:** Probability and stratified sampling ensures diverse employee voices (industries,
 regions, demographics, job levels)
- **Validated instruments:** Gallup Q12, Conference Board satisfaction scales, SHRM turnover driver 
checklist all psychometrically validated

**Limitations:**
- **Aggregated data obscures individual variation:** National averages may not represent our specific employee 
population
- **No organization-specific voice:** External employees, not OUR employees (their priorities may differ)
- **Limited early-career isolation:** Some surveys subset by age (Conference Board 25-34), but not exclusive 
early-career focus
- **Anonymized = less context:** Don't know which specific industries, organizations, or roles drove low
 satisfaction scores

**Overall Employee Voice Credibility:** High for validating general workforce retention challenges. Medium 
for our specific organizational context without internal validation.

#### Manager Input  
**Credibility Score:** Medium-High

**Strengths:**
- **Manager engagement tracked:** Gallup reports 27% manager engagement (down from 30%)—direct manager perspective
- **Manager training gap identified:** SHRM reports only 38% of organizations provide manager training—HR 
leaders acknowledging manager development need
- **Manager impact quantified:** Gallup 70% of team engagement attributable to manager—validates manager 
role importance

**Limitations:**
- **Limited manager-specific data:** Most survey data is employee-level; manager subset smaller
- **Manager voice indirect:** SHRM reports HR leaders' perspectives on managers, not managers' own voices 
about challenges
- **No manager implementation perspective:** Surveys don't ask managers "Can you deliver career development
 coaching? Do you have time/skills/tools?"
- **Missing: Manager buy-in data:** Don't know if managers support retention interventions or would resist

**Overall Manager Voice Credibility:** Medium-High for validating manager quality importance. Low for
 understanding manager implementation readiness and buy-in (would need internal manager surveys/focus groups).

#### HR/Organizational Leadership Input
**Credibility Score:** Medium-High

**Strengths:**
- **HR practitioner perspective included:** SHRM surveys 1,400 employees AND HR professionals (71% report
 difficulty retaining early-career talent)
- **Organizational challenges identified:** SHRM reports 58% of HR leaders cite budget constraints, 62% 
say managers lack training
- **Implementation gap acknowledged:** Only 38% of orgs provide manager training despite 68% of employees
 rating it important—leaders aware of gap
- **ROI data cited:** SHRM reports turnover costs 100-150% of salary—leadership economic case

**Limitations:**
- **HR professional sample size unclear:** SHRM survey includes employees and HR pros, but breakout not 
specified (may be <100 HR respondents)
- **CEO/CFO voice missing:** SHRM represents HR perspective; C-suite priorities and budget appetite not
 directly captured
- **Organizational success rates:** Some data on program outcomes (Patel's 65% success rate), but limited 
systematic tracking
- **Leadership buy-in unclear:** Know HR leaders see retention as important, but don't know if executive 
leadership prioritizes similarly

**Overall Leadership Voice Credibility:** Medium-High for HR leader perspective on retention challenges and 
resource constraints. Low for executive leadership strategic priorities and budget commitment.

#### External Stakeholder Validation (vs. Internal Stakeholder Voices)
**Credibility Score for External Benchmarks:** Medium

**Strengths:**
- **Scale and authority:** Gallup, Conference Board, SHRM are gold-standard survey organizations—highly 
credible
- **Independence:** Third-party surveys eliminate organizational bias (internal surveys may be influenced by
 politics, fear of retaliation)
- **Benchmarking value:** Provides comparison points for our organization ("Are we better/worse than national 
21% engagement?")
- **Validation of problem:** External data confirms retention challenges are widespread (not just our 
organization's failure)

**Limitations:**
- **Not OUR stakeholders:** External surveys represent general workforce, not our employees/managers/leaders 
specifically
- **Cannot assess org-specific buy-in:** External data says "retention is a problem" but doesn't tell us if OUR 
stakeholders agree
- **Missing implementation preferences:** External surveys don't ask "Would you support compensation adjustments?
 Manager training?" for our context
- **No stakeholder co-design:** External data is passive consumption; internal stakeholder engagement would enable
 collaborative solution design

**Recommendation:** External benchmark surveys provide HIGH-QUALITY stakeholder evidence for VALIDATION (problem
 exists, solution directions supported globally/nationally). However, should be SUPPLEMENTED with internal 
 stakeholder engagement (per evidence-stakeholder-methods.txt plan) for organization-specific buy-in, implementation
  preferences, and contextual adaptation.

### Evidence Triangulation Assessment

#### Cross-Method Validation
**Survey-Interview Convergence:** Not applicable—external evidence is survey-only (no interviews conducted)

**Cross-Survey Validation (Gallup + Conference Board + SHRM):**

**Converging Findings (High Confidence):**
1. ✅ Compensation dissatisfaction is #1 or #2 turnover driver (all 3 surveys agree)
2. ✅ Manager quality significantly impacts retention (all 3 surveys agree, Gallup most emphatic)
3. ✅ Career development/advancement gaps exist (Conference Board 48%, SHRM 54%)
4. ✅ Early-career employees at higher risk (Conference Board age breakdown, SHRM sensitivity data)
5. ✅ Overall engagement/satisfaction lower than ideal (Gallup 21%, Conference Board 62% suggests 38% not satisfied)

**Diverging Findings (Require Interpretation):**
1. ⚠️ Engagement level (Gallup 21%) vs. Satisfaction level (Conference Board 62%)
   - **Explanation:** Different constructs. Engagement = "fully invested, enthusiastic"; Satisfaction = "content,
    not unhappy." Can be satisfied but not engaged.
   - **Implication:** Both measures relevant. Satisfaction may be baseline; engagement is aspiration. 
   Low engagement (21%) more concerning for retention than moderate satisfaction (62%).

2. ⚠️ Manager satisfaction (Conference Board 62%) vs. Manager engagement impact (Gallup 70% attribution)
   - **Explanation:** Most employees satisfied with managers as individuals, but manager quality still primary
    driver of engagement. Satisfaction ≠ optimal impact.
   - **Implication:** Even "satisfactory" managers may not be excellent at driving engagement/retention. Room for
    improvement via training.

**Overall Cross-Survey Validation:** Strong convergence on key findings. Minor divergences explainable by construct
 differences, not contradictions.

#### Cross-Group Validation  
**Stakeholder Agreement Patterns:**

**Universal Agreement (Employees + Managers + HR Leaders, inferred from survey data):**
- Manager quality is critical for retention (Gallup employee data + SHRM HR leader data align)
- Compensation competitiveness matters (Conference Board employee dissatisfaction + SHRM HR leader acknowledgment
 align)

**Predictable Disagreement:**
- **Cannot assess from external survey data**—Surveys aggregate employee responses without breakouts by stakeholder
 group opposition (e.g., do managers disagree with employees on what matters?)

**Surprising Agreement:**
- SHRM HR leaders acknowledge manager training gap (38% provide it) despite 68% of employees rating it important—HR
 leaders agree with employees on need (not defensive)

**Limitation:** External survey data doesn't allow detailed cross-stakeholder comparison (employee vs. manager vs. 
 leadership perspectives not broken out within single survey). Would need internal stakeholder engagement to assess
  alignment/conflict across groups.

---

### Completeness Assessment

#### Topic Coverage

**Comprehensive Topics (Well-Covered by External Surveys):**
1. ✅ **Compensation satisfaction and turnover impact** - All 3 surveys provide extensive data (wage satisfaction %,
 percentile targets, turnover driver rankings)
2. ✅ **Manager quality and engagement relationship** - Gallup and SHRM provide detailed manager impact data (70% 
attribution, OR=2.1, training gaps)
3. ✅ **Career development and advancement gaps** - Conference Board and SHRM both measure advancement satisfaction 
and development dissatisfaction
4. ✅ **Overall engagement/satisfaction levels** - Gallup and Conference Board provide baseline engagement/
satisfaction
 metrics for benchmarking
5. ✅ **Early-career specific challenges** - Conference Board age breakouts (25-34), SHRM sensitivity analysis 
for early-career employees

**Partially Covered Topics (Some Data, But Gaps):**
1. ⚠️ **Solution preferences** - Surveys identify problems (low comp satisfaction, manager quality matters) but 
don't ask "Would you support 60th percentile pay target? Would you participate in manager training?"
2. ⚠️ **Organizational readiness** - SHRM reports resource constraints (58% budget, 62% manager capacity), but 
limited data on leadership commitment or employee willingness to engage with solutions
3. ⚠️ **Implementation barriers** - Some data (SHRM: only 38% provide manager training suggests barriers), but 
not comprehensive barrier inventory
4. ⚠️ **Success criteria** - Limited data on what employees/managers/leaders would define as "successful" retention 
improvement (Is 5-point turnover reduction enough? 10 points?)

**Missing Topics (Not Covered by External Surveys):**
1. ❌ **Organization-specific problem severity** - External benchmarks show national averages, but don't tell us 
OUR turnover rate, OUR engagement level, OUR compensation positioning
2. ❌ **Stakeholder buy-in for OUR interventions** - External data validates general solutions, but doesn't assess 
if OUR employees/managers/leaders would support specific interventions we're proposing
3. ❌ **Implementation preferences** - Don't know if OUR stakeholders prefer comp-first vs. manager-training-first,
 simultaneous vs. phased, transparent vs. quiet rollout
4. ❌ **Cultural fit** - External surveys don't capture OUR organizational culture (e.g., data-driven? employee-
centric? cost-conscious?) which affects intervention design
5. ❌ **Historical context** - External surveys don't capture OUR organization's past retention efforts (What's been
 tried? What failed? What credibility exists for new initiatives?)

**Overall Topic Coverage:** External surveys provide STRONG coverage of general workforce retention challenges
 (compensation, manager quality, development gaps, early-career issues). However, MISSING organization-specific 
 context (our severity, our stakeholder buy-in, our implementation constraints, our culture, our history). External
  evidence is necessary but insufficient for full decision-making.

#### Stakeholder Voice Representation

**Well-Represented Voices (via External Surveys):**
- ✅ **General employee population** (millions in Gallup, 1,400-1,500 in Conference Board/SHRM)—diverse industries, 
regions, demographics
- ✅ **Professional/white-collar employees** (Conference Board skews professional services; SHRM includes 
professional roles)—matches our target population type
- ✅ **Manager subset** (Gallup manager engagement data; SHRM manager impact data)—manager voice included in 
aggregate
- ✅ **HR practitioner/leader voice** (SHRM surveys HR professionals; SHRM reports organizational implementation
 challenges)—leadership perspective represented

**Underrepresented Voices (in External Surveys):**
- ⚠️ **Early-career employees exclusively** (Conference Board has age 25-34 breakout, but early-career not primary 
sample in any survey)—our target population is subset, not focus
- ⚠️ **Managers facing implementation challenges** (Gallup reports manager engagement low, but doesn't ask managers
 "What barriers do you face in developing teams?")—manager voice on obstacles limited
- ⚠️ **Frontline/first-level managers** (surveys may skew toward mid-level and senior managers)—early-career 
employees' direct managers may be underrepresented
- ⚠️ **Executive leadership** (SHRM includes HR leaders, but CEO/CFO/COO priorities unclear)—C-suite voice minimal

**Missing Voices (Not in External Surveys, Would Need Internal Engagement):**
- ❌ **OUR early-career employees** - Their specific retention drivers, satisfaction with OUR compensation, 
perception of OUR managers
- ❌ **OUR managers** - Their capacity for development coaching, training needs, buy-in for retention initiatives
- ❌ **OUR senior leadership** - Budget appetite, strategic priority of retention, timeline expectations, success 
criteria
- ❌ **OUR recent departures** - Why they left OUR organization specifically (exit interview themes, counteroffer
 insights)
- ❌ **OUR high-risk employees** (identified via predictive analytics)** - What would retain them specifically

**Overall Voice Representation:** External surveys provide broad stakeholder voice (employees, managers, HR leaders 
generally). However, MISSING OUR ORGANIZATION'S stakeholder voices. External evidence shows WHAT matters to 
stakeholders generally; internal engagement needed to understand OUR stakeholders' specific priorities, concerns,
 and buy-in.

### Utility Assessment for Decision-Making

#### Actionable Insights Quality

**High-Value Insights (Clearly Inform Decisions):**

1. ✅ **Target 50-65th percentile compensation** (Conference Board 42% wage satisfaction + SHRM 63% cite comp as
 driver → Compensation intervention needed)
   - **Decision Support:** Validates X variable (compensation) as intervention focus; suggests magnitude (move to
    at least 50th percentile minimum)

2. ✅ **Invest in manager development** (Gallup 70% attribution + SHRM only 38% provide training + 47% cite manager
 as turnover driver → Manager training gap)
   - **Decision Support:** Validates M variable (manager quality) as intervention focus; identifies implementation 
   gap (most orgs don't train managers adequately)

3. ✅ **Early-career employees are distinct high-priority group** (Conference Board 25-34 age group 15-20 points
 lower satisfaction → Early-career targeting justified)
   - **Decision Support:** Confirms population focus (0-3 year tenure, early-career professionals) aligns with 
   highest-risk group

4. ✅ **ROI is positive** (SHRM turnover costs 100-150% salary, engagement costs $438B globally → Intervention
 economics favorable)
   - **Decision Support:** Business case for retention investment; even modest retention improvements generate 
   3-5x ROI

5. ✅ **Combined approach likely needed** (Conference Board shows comp AND advancement both low satisfaction → 
Single intervention insufficient)
   - **Decision Support:** Validates X + M combined intervention design vs. compensation-only or development-only
    approaches

**Medium-Value Insights (Provide Useful Context):**

1. ⚠️ **18-24 month timeline expectations** (Gallup tracks annual trends, Conference Board shows satisfaction 
changing gradually → Effects take time)
   - **Decision Support:** Set realistic timeline expectations (not 6-month fix); plan for 2-year evaluation

2. ⚠️ **Manager engagement declining** (Gallup 30%→27% manager engagement → Managers struggling)
   - **Decision Support:** Manager training should address manager wellbeing/support, not just add responsibilities

3. ⚠️ **Budget constraints are common** (SHRM 58% HR leaders cite budget as barrier → Resource competition expected)
   - **Decision Support:** Anticipate budget negotiation challenges; prepare strong ROI case for CFO

**Low-Value Insights (Confirm Obvious or Too General):**

1. ❌ **"Retention is challenging"** (SHRM 71% HR leaders report difficulty retaining early-career → Confirms 
obvious)
   - **Decision Support:** Minimal—we already knew retention was a problem

2. ❌ **"Culture matters"** (Gallup emphasizes culture, Conference Board measures satisfaction → True but vague)
   - **Decision Support:** Minimal—doesn't specify WHICH cultural elements or HOW to improve

3. ❌ **"Employees want to be valued"** (Generic finding across all surveys → Truism)
   - **Decision Support:** Minimal—too general to guide specific interventions

**Overall Actionable Insights Quality:** High. External surveys provide specific, quantified insights directly
 informing
 intervention design (compensation percentiles, manager training need, early-career focus, combined approach, ROI).
  Some medium-value contextual insights (timelines, manager struggles, budget constraints). Few low-value obvious 
  confirmations.

#### Decision Support Capability

**Problem Definition Support:** ✅ **Strong**
- External surveys validate that early-career retention IS a problem (Conference Board 25-34 lower satisfaction, 
SHRM early-career sensitivity)
- Quantify problem magnitude (Gallup 21% engagement, Conference Board 42% wage satisfaction, SHRM 63% cite comp as
 driver)
- Identify problem drivers (compensation, manager quality, career development)
- **Confidence:** HIGH that problem definition is accurate and data-supported

**Solution Design Support:** ✅ **Strong**  
- Validate intervention components (compensation adjustment + manager training both supported by convergent survey 
data)
- Suggest intervention magnitude (50-65th percentile comp target, manager training investment justified)
- Confirm logic model pathway (X→M→Y supported: comp→satisfaction→retention, manager→engagement→retention)
- **Confidence:** HIGH that solution design aligns with stakeholder-validated priorities

**Implementation Planning Support:** ⚠️ **Moderate**
- Identify implementation barriers (SHRM: 58% budget, 62% manager capacity, 38% currently train managers)
- Suggest timeline expectations (Gallup/Conference Board annual tracking suggests 18-24 months)
- Highlight change management needs (Gallup manager engagement low → managers need support, not just demands)
- **Limitation:** External surveys don't provide implementation HOW-TO (sequencing, communication, phasing)—need 
practitioner evidence for tactics
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM for implementation planning—validates challenges but doesn't provide detailed roadmap

**Success Criteria Support:** ⚠️ **Moderate**
- Provide benchmarks for success (Gallup 21% engagement → target 30%+? Conference Board 42% wage satisfaction → 
target 60%+?)
- Quantify economic impact (SHRM $438B disengagement cost, 100-150% turnover cost → calculate ROI targets)
- **Limitation:** Surveys don't ask "What retention improvement would you consider successful?" or "What engagement
 level is your goal?"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM for success criteria—provides baseline benchmarks but not explicit organizational goals

## Overall Evidence Quality Rating

### Strengths of Stakeholder Evidence

**Top 5 Strengths:**

1. ✅ **Exceptional source credibility** - Gallup, Conference Board, SHRM are gold-standard survey organizations
 with rigorous methodologies, large samples, established reputations

2. ✅ **Strong convergent validity** - All 3 independent surveys agree on core findings (compensation critical,
 manager quality critical, early-career at risk, development gaps)—triangulation increases confidence

3. ✅ **Large representative samples** - Millions (Gallup globally), 1,400-1,500 (Conference Board, SHRM in U.S.)
 employees represented—not small convenience samples

4. ✅ **Quantified and specific** - Precise statistics (21% engagement, 42% wage satisfaction, 70% attribution to
 manager, 63% cite compensation as driver)—enables data-driven decision making

5. ✅ **Validates logic model** - External stakeholder data independently confirms X→M→Y pathway
 (compensation→satisfaction/manager quality→retention) that scientific evidence also supports

### Limitations of Stakeholder Evidence  

**Top 5 Limitations:**

1. ❌ **External benchmarks, not internal voices** - Surveys represent general workforce, not OUR organization's 
employees, managers, leaders specifically—limits organization-specific buy-in assessment

2. ❌ **Missing implementation preferences** - Surveys identify WHAT matters (comp, managers, development) but not 
HOW stakeholders want solutions implemented (transparent vs. quiet? phased vs. all-at-once? compensation-first vs.
 simultaneous?)

3. ❌ **Aggregated data obscures variation** - National/global averages may not represent our specific industry, 
geography, culture, workforce demographics—our context may differ from average

4. ❌ **Survey-only methodology** - No qualitative depth (interviews, focus groups) to understand nuances, 
contextual factors, stakeholder reasoning behind survey responses

5. ❌ **No organization-specific severity data** - External benchmarks show retention is challenging generally, 
but don't tell us OUR turnover rate, OUR engagement level, OUR compensation positioning relative to market

### Confidence Level for Decision-Making
**Overall Confidence:** Medium-High (75-80%)

**Justification:**

**High Confidence Areas (90%+):**
- Problem exists and is widespread (validated by 3 independent authoritative surveys)
- Compensation and manager quality are primary retention drivers (convergent findings across millions of employees)
- Early-career employees are high-risk retention group (Conference Board age data, SHRM sensitivity analysis)
- Solutions (compensation adjustment + manager training) align with stakeholder-validated priorities (all surveys
 point to same intervention directions)

**Medium Confidence Areas (60-75%):**
- Our organization's problem severity matches external benchmarks (could be better or worse—don't have internal data
 yet)
- Our stakeholders will support proposed interventions (external data shows general workforce supports
 comp/development, but OUR employees/managers/leaders may differ)
- Implementation approach will resonate with our culture (external surveys provide generic insights, not 
culture-specific guidance)
- Success benchmarks apply to our context (21% engagement, 42% wage satisfaction are national averages—our 

targets may differ)

**Recommendation for Confidence Level:**
- Use external stakeholder evidence with HIGH confidence for VALIDATION (problem is real, solution directions are
 sound, priorities align with broader workforce)
- Supplement with internal stakeholder engagement (per evidence-stakeholder-methods.txt plan) to increase confidence
 in IMPLEMENTATION specifics (buy-in, preferences, contextual adaptation, success criteria)



- Current external evidence is STRONG but INCOMPLETE—sufficient to justify intervention direction, insufficient to
 finalize detailed implementation plan without internal voices

### Recommendations for Evidence Improvement

**Critical Enhancements (High Priority):**

1. **Conduct internal stakeholder surveys** (per evidence-stakeholder-methods.txt plan)
   - Target: 100-150 early-career employees, 40-50 managers, 15-20 HR/senior leaders
   - Purpose: Validate external findings in OUR context, assess OUR problem severity, gauge buy-in for OUR 
   proposed solutions
   - Timeline: 2-week survey window (Weeks 1-3 per methods plan)
   - Expected Outcome: Organization-specific data on turnover intent, compensation satisfaction, manager
    quality ratings, intervention support

2. **Conduct stakeholder interviews** (per evidence-stakeholder-methods.txt plan)
   - Target: 15-20 total (8-10 early-career, 4-5 managers, 3-4 HR/senior leaders)
   - Purpose: Qualitative depth on WHY external findings apply (or don't) to our context, HOW to implement 
   
   effectively, WHAT success looks like for our organization
   - Timeline: Weeks 2-5 (concurrent with survey)
   - Expected Outcome: Implementation preferences, cultural considerations, change management insights, stakeholder 
   concerns

3. **Conduct focus groups** (per evidence-stakeholder-methods.txt plan)
   - Target: 3-4 sessions with 6-8 participants each (early-career employees, managers, mixed groups)
   - Purpose: Interactive discussion on solutions, barriers, feasibility—co-design intervention with stakeholders
   - Timeline: Weeks 4-6 (after initial survey data reviewed)
   - Expected Outcome: Refined intervention design, barrier identification, stakeholder buy-in building

**Moderate Enhancements (Medium Priority):**

4. **Analyze internal HR data** (per evidence-organizational-methods.txt plan)
   - Collect: Turnover rates (overall and early-career subset), exit interview themes, engagement survey results
    (if exist), compensation positioning vs. market
   - Purpose: Quantify OUR problem severity, compare to external benchmarks (are we better/worse than 21% 
   engagement, 42% wage satisfaction?)
   - Timeline: Weeks 1-4 (concurrent with stakeholder engagement)
   - Expected Outcome: Baseline metrics, gap analysis vs. benchmarks

5. **Conduct exit interviews with recent early-career departures** (per evidence-stakeholder-methods.txt)
   - Target: 30-40 employees who left in past 6-12 months (0-3 year tenure)
   - Purpose: Understand why people LEFT our organization specifically (not general workforce trends)
   - Timeline: Weeks 2-4 (if feasible to contact former employees)
   - Expected Outcome: Organization-specific turnover drivers, counteroffer insights, "what would have retained
    you" data

**Nice-to-Have Enhancements (Low Priority):**

6. **Compare industry-specific external benchmarks** - Seek tech-industry-specific retention surveys (e.g.,
 Radford compensation survey, Dice tech talent survey) for closer industry match than general workforce surveys

7. **Pulse survey after intervention launch** - Plan for ongoing stakeholder feedback (3-month, 6-month, 12-month
 pulse surveys) to track stakeholder perceptions as interventions roll out

---

**Final Stakeholder Evidence Appraisal Summary:**

**Current State (External Benchmarks Only):**
- **Strengths:** Highly credible sources (Gallup, Conference Board, SHRM), large representative samples, convergent
 findings, quantified data, validates logic model
- **Limitations:** External benchmarks not internal voices, missing implementation preferences, aggregated data 
obscures variation, survey-only methodology, no organization-specific severity data

**Confidence for Decision-Making:**
- **Problem validation:** HIGH confidence (90%+) that early-career retention is widespread challenge driven by 
compensation and manager quality
- **Solution direction:** HIGH confidence (85%+) that compensation adjustment + manager training align with 
stakeholder priorities
- **Implementation specifics:** MEDIUM confidence (60-70%) in how to implement without internal stakeholder 
validation
- **Organization-specific fit:** MEDIUM confidence (65%) that external findings apply to our context without
 internal data

**Recommended Path Forward:**
1. Use current external stakeholder evidence to justify intervention direction and business case (strong validation)
2. Conduct internal stakeholder engagement (surveys, interviews, focus groups per evidence-stakeholder-methods.txt)
 to finalize implementation approach
3. Integrate internal stakeholder data with external benchmarks for complete stakeholder evidence picture (external
 = 
validation + benchmarking; internal = buy-in + contextual adaptation)
4. Re-assess confidence levels after internal stakeholder data collected (expect increase to 85-90% confidence 
overall)

External stakeholder evidence is STRONG FOUNDATION but needs INTERNAL SUPPLEMENTATION for high-confidence 
implementation.
