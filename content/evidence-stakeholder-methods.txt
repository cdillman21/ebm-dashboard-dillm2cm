# Stakeholder Evidence: How I'd Gather Employee & Manager Feedback
# My plan for understanding what stakeholders actually think (using external data since I'm a student)

## What I Wanted to Learn
**Main Goal:** Understand what early-career employees think about their pay, development opportunities, and managers - basically, what makes them stay or leave.

**Secondary Goal:** Get feedback from managers and leadership on whether my proposed solutions (better pay, manager training) are actually feasible and what concerns they'd have.

## Who I Would Talk To (If I Worked There)

### Internal Stakeholders I'd Survey
#### Management/Leadership
- **Who:** VP-level and up (C-suite, department heads who manage early-career people)
- **How Many:** 15-20 leaders
- **How:** One-on-one interviews (30 min) or small group discussions (5-6 people, 60 min)
- **Key Questions I'd Ask:** 
  - What retention problems do you see in your teams?
  - What budget/resources are available for retention fixes?
  - What worries you about adjusting pay or adding new programs?
  - How would you measure if retention initiatives worked?
- **Response Rate I'd Expect:** 75-85% (leaders care about this!)

#### Early-Career Employees (THE MAIN GROUP!)
- **Who:** People with 0-3 years experience in professional/tech roles
- **How Many:** 100-150 survey responses, plus 15-20 interviews
- **How:** Anonymous online survey + optional follow-up interviews
- **Key Questions I'd Ask:** 
  - What factors most affect whether you'll stay or leave?
  - How satisfied are you with your pay package?
  - Are you getting enough career development and feedback?
  - Is your manager helping you grow?
  - What would make you want to stay long-term?
- **Response Rate I'd Expect:** 40-50% for survey, 15-20% for interviews (I'd offer gift cards as incentive)

#### Managers of Early-Career Employees
- **Who:** First-line and mid-level managers with direct reports who have 0-3 years experience
- **How Many:** 40-50 managers
- **How:** Online survey + focus groups (6-8 managers per session)
- **Key Questions I'd Ask:** 
  - What challenges do YOU face keeping your early-career team members?
  - Do you have good tools/training to help with career development conversations?
  - What feedback do you get from your team about pay and growth?
  - What support do you need to improve retention?

**For Managers:**
- "What challenges do you face keeping early-career employees?" (Open-ended - let them explain)
- "How good are the tools available to support team development?" (1-5 scale)
- "What % of your early-career employees quit in the past 12 months?" (<10%, 10-20%, 20-30%, >30%)

**Solution Feedback Questions (All Stakeholders):**

important)

## Access Strategy

### Internal Permissions
**Approvals Needed:**
1. CHRO approval for employee surveys and manager interviews
2. Legal review of survey questions (privacy/compliance)
3. Department head approval for focus group participation during work hours
4. Communications team approval for survey invitation messaging

**Timeline for Approvals:** 2-3 weeks advance notice

### Recruitment Strategy

**For Surveys:**
- Email invitation from CHRO with project explanation

- 2-week response window

**For Interviews:**
- Solicitation email with volunteer sign-up link
- Purposive sampling to ensure diversity (department, tenure, performance level, demographics)
- Confirmation email with calendar invite and consent form

**For Focus Groups:**
- Manager nominates willing participants OR open call for volunteers
- Ensure mix of high performers, solid contributors, varied tenures (0-3 years)
- Schedule during work hours to show organizational commitment

### Engagement Safeguards
**Confidentiality:**
- Survey responses anonymous (no IP tracking)
- Interview quotes attributed only by role type (e.g., "Early-career employee in Engineering")

### Response Rate Contingency Plans
**If early-career survey response <30% by Day 10:**

### Alternative Methods
**If survey fatigue is high:**
- Shorten survey to 5-7 critical questions only

  - Statistical significance testing where sample size permits (t-tests, chi-square)
  
- **Integration Plan:** 
  - Triangulate survey quantitative results with qualitative interview themes
  - Use focus group discussions to validate/refine survey findings
  - Create evidence matrix mapping themes across methods (survey + interviews + focus groups)
  - Weight evidence by source credibility and consistency

### Analysis Timeline
