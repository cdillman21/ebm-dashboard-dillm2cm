## Logic Model: Theory of How Our Intervention Works

The Logic Model provides a visual and conceptual framework showing how our intervention (Retention Acceleration Program) is expected to improve early-career retention. It makes explicit our assumptions about causality.

### Logic Model Structure: X → M → Y

**X (Independent Variable - The Intervention):**
- **Manager Capability Development:** Training focused on 3 core behaviors (weekly 1-on-1s, constructive feedback, career development conversations)
- **Compensation Competitiveness:** Adjustment to 90th percentile market rate for early-career employees

**M (Mediator - The Mechanism):**
- **Improved Job Satisfaction:** Employees feel more supported, valued, and engaged
- **Enhanced Manager Quality:** Managers become more effective at coaching, feedback, and development
- **Stronger Career Growth Perception:** Employees see clearer path for career advancement

**Y (Dependent Variable - The Outcome):**
- **Increased Retention Rate:** 60% → 75%+ retention over 24 months
- **Reduced Voluntary Turnover:** Fewer employees choosing to leave

### Causal Chain Explanation

**How X Causes M:**
1. **Manager Training (X1) → Improved Manager Quality (M2)**
   - Managers learn evidence-based coaching, feedback, and development skills
   - Practice + feedback + ongoing coaching helps managers apply skills consistently
   - Employees notice and experience better quality 1-on-1s, more constructive feedback, more career development support

2. **Compensation Adjustment (X2) → Job Satisfaction (M1)**
   - Competitive pay removes financial anxiety and "am I being taken advantage of?" concern
   - Fair compensation signals organization values early-career employees
   - Pay satisfaction increases (even if absolute pay doesn't make employees wealthy)

3. **Improved Manager Quality (M2) + Competitive Comp (X2) → Career Growth Perception (M3)**
   - Managers having career development conversations makes growth path visible
   - Fair compensation + growth opportunity creates compelling value proposition
   - Employees see reason to stay and invest in organization long-term

**How M Causes Y:**
4. **Job Satisfaction (M1) + Manager Quality (M2) + Career Growth (M3) → Retention (Y)**
   - Satisfied employees with good managers and growth opportunities are less likely to seek external opportunities
   - When external recruiters call, employees have compelling reason to say no
   - Retention decisions happen at individual level ("Should I stay or leave?") - our intervention shifts calculus toward "stay"

### Assumptions Underlying Logic Model

**Critical Assumptions (if these are wrong, model fails):**
1. **Manager Quality is Trainable:** Managers can learn and consistently apply coaching/feedback/development skills *(Evidence: STRONG)*
2. **Manager Quality Drives Retention:** Better manager quality actually causes higher retention, not just correlates *(Evidence: STRONG but mostly correlational)*
3. **Compensation is Necessary Foundation:** Can't train way out of pay problem - comp must be competitive *(Evidence: STRONG)*
4. **Combined Approach is Synergistic:** Manager training + comp together > sum of parts *(Evidence: MODERATE)*
5. **Generalizes to Our Context:** What worked in research contexts will work in our organization *(Evidence: MODERATE - pilot will test)*

**Moderating Factors (things that could make intervention more or less effective):**
- **Manager Willingness:** If managers resist training or don't authentically engage, M2 won't improve
- **Organizational Culture:** If broader culture is toxic, good managers can't overcome it
- **Labor Market Conditions:** Tight labor market makes retention harder regardless of intervention
- **Economic Conditions:** Recession could increase retention regardless of our intervention (confound)
- **Leadership Stability:** Major organizational changes could disrupt intervention effectiveness

**Confounding Variables (things we need to control for in evaluation):**
- **Economic Recession:** Could increase retention for reasons unrelated to our intervention
- **Competitor Actions:** Competitors also raising comp could offset our adjustments
- **Organizational Changes:** Restructuring, layoffs, new leadership could affect retention independent of intervention
- **Self-Selection in Pilot:** Volunteer managers may be better than average (not representative)

## Evaluation Framework Overview

### Evaluation Questions

**Primary Evaluation Question:** 
Did the Retention Acceleration Program (RAP) successfully improve early-career employee retention from 60% to 75%+ over 24 months?

**Secondary Evaluation Questions:**
1. **Effectiveness:** Which components of the intervention (manager training vs. compensation) had the biggest impact on retention?
2. **Implementation:** How well was the intervention implemented? Did managers actually apply the skills they learned?
3. **Mechanism:** Did the intervention work through the hypothesized mediators (job satisfaction, manager quality, career growth perception)?
4. **Stakeholder Satisfaction:** Do managers and employees view the intervention positively? Would they recommend continuing it?
5. **Unintended Consequences:** Did the intervention create any unexpected positive or negative effects (e.g., resentment from non-pilot employees, equity concerns, manager burnout)?
6. **Cost-Effectiveness:** Did the benefits (prevented turnover costs) outweigh the investment? What was the ROI?
7. **Sustainability:** Can the intervention be maintained long-term without external consultant? Does it require ongoing investment?
8. **Generalizability:** Did the intervention work equally well across different departments, manager types, and employee groups?

### Evaluation Approach

**Evaluation Type:** Mixed - both Formative (during implementation to improve program) and Summative (after implementation to assess impact)

**Evaluation Design:** Quasi-Experimental Before-and-After with Comparison Group
- **Pilot Phase:** Pilot teams (intervention) vs. Control teams (no intervention) - with-and-without comparison
- **Full Rollout:** Organization-wide before-and-after comparison (pre-intervention baseline vs. post-intervention)
- **Longitudinal Design:** Track changes over 24 months to assess sustained impact

**Mixed Methods Approach:**
- **Quantitative:** Retention rates, engagement scores, manager effectiveness ratings, turnover cost calculations, survey data (establish effect size and statistical significance)
- **Qualitative:** Manager interviews, employee focus groups, exit interviews, observational data (understand mechanisms, barriers, and lived experience)
- **Integration:** Quantitative shows WHAT happened and HOW MUCH; qualitative shows WHY and HOW

## Data Analysis Plan

### Quantitative Analysis

#### Outcome Analysis

**Primary Outcome Analysis: Retention Rate**
- **Statistical Approach:**
  - Descriptive statistics: Calculate retention rate each quarter, plot trend over time
  - Comparison of means: T-test comparing pilot teams vs. control teams (Month 12), paired t-test comparing pre-intervention vs. post-intervention (Month 18)
  - Effect size calculation: Cohen's d to quantify magnitude of improvement
- **Comparison Strategy:**
  - Pilot phase: Pilot teams vs. Control teams (with-and-without comparison)
  - Full rollout: Pre-intervention baseline vs. During-intervention vs. Post-intervention (before-and-after comparison)
  - Longitudinal: Quarterly retention rates plotted over 24 months to see trajectory
- **Significance Criteria:**
  - **Statistically Significant:** p < 0.05 (retention improvement is unlikely due to chance)
  - **Practically Significant:** 10+ percentage point improvement (meaningful business impact, not just statistically detectable)
  - **Target:** 15+ percentage point improvement (60% → 75%+)

**Secondary Outcome Analysis: Engagement, Manager Effectiveness, Job Satisfaction, Career Growth**
- **Statistical Approach:** Same as retention (t-tests, effect sizes, trend analysis)
- **Comparison Strategy:** Pilot vs. control, pre vs. post, quarterly trends
- **Significance Criteria:**
  - Engagement: 15-20+ point improvement (statistically and practically significant)
  - Manager Effectiveness: 25-30+ point improvement
  - Job Satisfaction: 15-20+ point improvement
  - Career Growth: 20-25+ point improvement

**Mediator Analysis (Does M mediate X→Y relationship?):**
- **Question:** Did the intervention improve retention THROUGH the mediators (job satisfaction, manager quality, career growth)?
- **Approach:** Correlation and regression analysis
  - Step 1: Does X (intervention) predict M (mediators)? YES if manager training → improved manager effectiveness ratings
  - Step 2: Does M predict Y (retention)? YES if improved manager effectiveness → higher retention
  - Step 3: Does X→Y relationship weaken when controlling for M? YES if intervention effect on retention is explained by mediator improvements
- **Interpretation:** If mediators explain the retention improvement, our Logic Model is validated. If retention improves WITHOUT mediator changes, our theory is wrong.

#### Trend Analysis

**How We'll Examine Trends Over Time:**
- **Line graphs:** Plot each KPI quarterly over 24 months to visualize trajectory
- **Segmented regression:** Did slope change after intervention started? (pre-intervention trend vs. post-intervention trend)
- **Moving averages:** Smooth out quarterly fluctuations to see overall direction

**Patterns We'll Look For:**
- **Immediate improvement:** Do leading indicators (engagement, manager effectiveness) improve within 3-6 months?
- **Delayed improvement:** Does retention improve later (12-18 months) as expected?
- **Sustained improvement:** Do gains hold or fade over time?
- **Accelerating vs. plateauing:** Are we still improving or have we maxed out?

### Qualitative Analysis

#### Thematic Analysis

**Interview Analysis Approach:**
- **Step 1:** Transcribe all manager and employee interviews
- **Step 2:** Read transcripts multiple times to identify recurring themes
- **Step 3:** Code transcripts (tag segments with theme labels: "manager resistance," "skill application barriers," "positive employee response," etc.)
- **Step 4:** Group codes into broader themes
- **Step 5:** Count frequency of themes (How many managers mentioned this barrier?)
- **Step 6:** Extract illustrative quotes for each theme

**Coding Strategy:**
- **Deductive Codes:** Pre-defined codes based on evaluation questions and Logic Model (e.g., "improved job satisfaction," "manager training effectiveness," "compensation impact")
- **Inductive Codes:** Emergent codes based on what participants actually say (e.g., if multiple people mention "time constraints," add that code)
- **Two Coders:** Have two people code independently, compare, resolve discrepancies (increases reliability)

**Theme Identification:**
- **Implementation Themes:** What made implementation easy or hard? (e.g., time constraints, leadership support, training quality)
- **Mechanism Themes:** How did the intervention work? (e.g., "managers became better listeners," "employees felt more valued")
- **Outcome Themes:** What changed and why? (e.g., "I'm staying because my manager invests in me now")
- **Unintended Consequences:** Unexpected positive or negative effects

#### Content Analysis

**Document Analysis Approach:**
- **Exit Interview Data:** Code departure reasons into categories (manager, compensation, career growth, work-life balance, other), calculate % in each category each quarter, track trends
- **Coaching Notes:** Identify common manager development themes and challenges
- **Performance Review Templates:** Check whether manager effectiveness metrics are included (sustainability indicator)

**Observation Analysis:**
- **Workshop Observations:** Rate engagement level, practice quality, manager questions asked
- **1-on-1 Observations:** Use rubric to score whether manager demonstrated trained skills (open-ended questions, specific feedback, career development discussion)
- **Calculate Fidelity Score:** % of trained behaviors observed during spot checks

### Mixed Methods Integration

**How We'll Combine Quantitative and Qualitative Findings:**

1. **Quantitative First:** Analyze survey and retention data to identify WHAT happened and HOW MUCH (e.g., "Retention improved 12 percentage points; engagement up 18 points")

2. **Qualitative Explains WHY:** Use interviews and focus groups to understand mechanisms (e.g., "Interviews reveal employees stayed because they now have career development conversations with managers")

3. **Triangulation:** Look for convergence across data sources
   - If quantitative shows manager effectiveness up 30 points AND qualitative shows employees consistently praising managers AND observations show managers applying skills → STRONG CONFIDENCE in finding
   - If quantitative shows improvement BUT qualitative shows skepticism → INVESTIGATE DISCREPANCY

4. **Divergence Investigation:** When data sources conflict, dig deeper
   - Example: If retention improves BUT exit interviews still cite manager issues → Maybe we're retaining some but not addressing all manager problems
   - Example: If engagement up BUT employees complain in interviews → Maybe survey doesn't capture their real concerns

**Triangulation Approach:**
- **Data Triangulation:** Multiple data sources (surveys + interviews + exit data + observations)
- **Method Triangulation:** Quantitative + qualitative methods
- **Investigator Triangulation:** Multiple people analyze data independently, compare conclusions
- **Theory Triangulation:** Test Logic Model from multiple angles (does X→M? does M→Y? does X→Y?)

**Integration Reporting:**
- Present quantitative findings with qualitative illustrations (e.g., "Retention improved 12% for pilot teams. As one employee said, 'I was ready to leave until my manager started really investing in my development.'")
- Use qualitative to explain quantitative outliers (e.g., "One team had zero improvement despite training - interviews revealed that manager didn't authentically engage")

---

## Success Criteria and Interpretation

### Success Thresholds

#### Must-Achieve Criteria (Program considered successful ONLY if these are met)

**Criterion 1: Retention Rate Improvement of 10+ Percentage Points**
- **Measurement:** Retention rate for early-career employees (% staying 12+ months)
- **Threshold:** 70%+ by Month 18 (minimum 10 percentage point improvement from 60% baseline)
- **Rationale:** If retention doesn't improve by at least 10 points, program failed its primary goal. Anything less doesn't justify the investment.

**Criterion 2: Mediators Show Improvement (Logic Model Validation)**
- **Measurement:** Manager effectiveness ratings + Job satisfaction scores
- **Threshold:** Manager effectiveness up 20+ points AND job satisfaction up 10+ points by Month 12
- **Rationale:** If retention improves WITHOUT mediator improvements, it's likely due to external factors (recession, labor market) not our intervention. We need to see the MECHANISM working.

**Criterion 3: Cost-Benefit is Positive**
- **Measurement:** Turnover cost savings vs. program investment
- **Threshold:** At least break-even by Month 24 (savings ≥ investment)
- **Rationale:** If program loses money even after 2 years, it's not sustainable regardless of retention improvement.

#### Should-Achieve Criteria (Important for full success but not make-or-break)

**Criterion 1: Retention Target of 75%+ Achieved**
- **Measurement:** Retention rate
- **Target:** 75%+ by Month 24 (15 percentage point improvement)
- **Rationale:** This is our aspirational goal based on evidence. Achieving it means program worked as expected.

**Criterion 2: Manager Skill Application is High and Sustained**
- **Measurement:** % of managers consistently doing weekly 1-on-1s, feedback, career conversations
- **Target:** 80%+ skill application through Month 24 (not just during training period)
- **Rationale:** If managers apply skills initially but stop after 12 months, program won't have long-term impact.

**Criterion 3: Stakeholder Satisfaction is High**
- **Measurement:** Manager and employee ratings of program value
- **Target:** 70%+ rate program as valuable/very valuable
- **Rationale:** If stakeholders hate the program even though it works, it won't be sustainable.

**Criterion 4: Voluntary Turnover Reasons Shift**
- **Measurement:** % of departures citing manager relationship
- **Target:** <50% by Month 18 (down from 68%)
- **Rationale:** Shows we're addressing root cause, not just masking problem.

#### Could-Achieve Criteria (Nice-to-have outcomes)

**Criterion 1: Productivity Improvement**
- **Target:** 10-15% productivity improvement for teams with trained managers
- **Rationale:** Secondary benefit that strengthens business case

**Criterion 2: Promotion Rate Increase**
- **Target:** 20%+ increase in internal promotion rate for early-career employees
- **Rationale:** Retaining AND developing is better than just retaining

**Criterion 3: Employer Brand Improvement**
- **Target:** Higher Glassdoor ratings, easier recruiting, more employee referrals
- **Rationale:** Shows program creates broader competitive advantage

### Interpretation Framework

#### Strong Success Indicators (Program exceeded expectations)
- Retention improved 15+ percentage points (75%+ achieved)
- All mediators showed strong improvement (manager effectiveness +30, job satisfaction +20, engagement +20)
- ROI is 150%+ by Month 24
- Manager skill application sustained at 80%+ through Month 24
- Stakeholder satisfaction is 75%+
- Voluntary turnover reasons shifted significantly (<40% cite manager)
- Evidence of cultural shift (manager capability embedded in systems)

**Interpretation:** Program worked as intended. Scale and sustain. Use as model for other HR interventions.

#### Moderate Success Indicators (Program worked but with limitations)
- Retention improved 10-14 percentage points (70-74% achieved - good but not great)
- Mediators showed moderate improvement (manager effectiveness +20-25, satisfaction +10-15)
- ROI is break-even to 100% by Month 24
- Manager skill application is 65-79% (decent but some dropoff)
- Stakeholder satisfaction is 60-69%
- Some shift in turnover reasons but manager still frequently cited

**Interpretation:** Program had positive impact but didn't achieve full potential. Investigate barriers and make adjustments before declaring victory. May need ongoing investment or modifications to sustain gains.

#### Weak Success or Failure Indicators (Program didn't work as expected)
- Retention improved <10 percentage points (<70% achieved)
- Mediators showed minimal or no improvement (manager effectiveness +10 or less)
- ROI is negative or barely break-even
- Manager skill application dropped below 65% or never got above 70%
- Stakeholder satisfaction below 60%
- No shift in voluntary turnover reasons (manager still cited by 60%+)

**Interpretation:** Program failed to achieve core objectives. Conduct root cause analysis:
- **Implementation Failure:** Did we execute poorly? (low-quality training, poor manager engagement)
- **Theory Failure:** Is our Logic Model wrong? (maybe manager quality doesn't actually drive retention in our context)
- **Contextual Mismatch:** Do external factors override intervention? (labor market, economic conditions, org culture too toxic to fix with manager training)

**Decision:** Don't continue as-is. Either redesign significantly or stop and try different approach.

#### Unintended Consequences Assessment

**Positive Unintended Consequences (Watch for):**
- Improved cross-team collaboration (managers share best practices)
- Managers feel more confident and effective in broader role (not just retention)
- Spillover to experienced employees (managers improve quality for all, not just early-career)
- Reduced manager turnover (managers stay because they feel supported and developed)
- Stronger leadership pipeline (trained managers become future senior leaders)

**Negative Unintended Consequences (Watch for and mitigate):**
- **Resentment from non-pilot employees:** "Why did they get raises and we didn't?"
  - *Monitoring:* Pulse survey of non-pilot employees, informal feedback
  - *Mitigation:* Transparent communication about pilot purpose, timeline for rollout to others
- **Manager burnout:** More 1-on-1s, feedback, career conversations takes time
  - *Monitoring:* Manager stress/workload questions in surveys, coaching session topics
  - *Mitigation:* Efficiency tips, time management support, realistic expectations (weekly 1-on-1s can be 15-20 min)
- **Unrealistic employee expectations:** Career development conversations may raise expectations we can't meet (limited promotions available)
  - *Monitoring:* Exit interviews (are people leaving because promised promotions didn't happen?)
  - *Mitigation:* Train managers on realistic career conversations (growth ≠ promotion every year)
- **Gaming the system:** Managers check boxes (have 1-on-1s) without authentic engagement
  - *Monitoring:* Employee feedback on manager quality (do employees perceive improvement?), observation spot checks
  - *Mitigation:* Emphasize quality over quantity, use employee feedback in manager performance reviews
- **Equity concerns:** Different managers apply skills differently, creating inconsistent employee experience
  - *Monitoring:* Variation in manager effectiveness ratings across managers
  - *Mitigation:* Additional support for struggling managers, accountability for low performers

## Stakeholder Feedback Integration

### Feedback Collection Strategy

#### Formal Feedback Mechanisms

**Mechanism 1: Quarterly Executive Briefings**
- **Frequency:** Every 3 months (Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24)
- **Participants:** Executive sponsor + leadership team
- **Process:** Present KPI dashboard, key findings, barriers, and recommendations. Get leadership input on decisions (continue/modify/stop). Document feedback and decisions.
- **Purpose:** Keep leadership informed, maintain support, make course corrections based on leadership priorities

**Mechanism 2: Manager Feedback Sessions**
- **Frequency:** Monthly during pilot (Months 2-5), quarterly during rollout (Months 6-24)
- **Participants:** Participating managers (pilot managers initially, all managers later)
- **Process:** Facilitated discussion or survey asking: What's working? What's not? What support do you need? What should we change?
- **Purpose:** Continuous improvement based on manager experience

**Mechanism 3: Employee Pulse Surveys**
- **Frequency:** Quarterly
- **Participants:** All early-career employees (pilot + control, then organization-wide)
- **Process:** Include open-ended question: "What could make this program better?" or "What feedback do you have on the changes you've experienced?"
- **Purpose:** Get employee perspective on program impact and areas for improvement

#### Informal Feedback Mechanisms  

**Mechanism: Open Door Policy + Anonymous Feedback Channel**
- **Approach:**
  - HR program manager has "open door" for managers and employees to share feedback anytime
  - Anonymous feedback form (online) for sensitive concerns
  - Capture informal hallway conversations, one-on-one comments, Slack messages
- **Documentation:** Log informal feedback themes in shared document, review monthly to identify patterns
- **Purpose:** Catch issues early before they become major problems

### Feedback Integration Process

**How We'll Incorporate Stakeholder Feedback:**

1. **Monthly Feedback Review:** HR program manager reviews all feedback collected (formal + informal), identifies themes and urgent issues

2. **Rapid Response:** Urgent issues addressed within 1 week (e.g., if manager reports training conflict with major deadline, adjust schedule)

3. **Quarterly Adjustment Planning:** Every quarter, synthesize feedback and decide on adjustments:
   - Minor tweaks: Implement immediately (e.g., change workshop timing, add resource to manager library)
   - Major changes: Pilot test with small group before organization-wide (e.g., change training curriculum)

4. **Stakeholder Validation:** Test proposed changes with stakeholders before implementing (e.g., "We're thinking of changing from 3-hour workshops to 2-hour + self-paced modules - thoughts?")

5. **Communication Loop:** Tell stakeholders what we heard and what we're changing (e.g., "You said workshops were too long. We're piloting shorter format next quarter.")

**Decision-Making Process:**
- **Keep/Continue:** Feedback is positive, results are positive → maintain current approach
- **Modify/Adjust:** Feedback suggests improvements, results are mixed → make targeted changes
- **Pause/Investigate:** Feedback is negative, results are disappointing → pause and conduct root cause analysis before proceeding
- **Stop/Redesign:** Feedback is overwhelmingly negative, results show no impact → stop current approach and redesign or abandon

## Continuous Improvement Process

### Learning Integration

**How We'll Use Evaluation Results for Ongoing Improvement:**

1. **Quarterly Learning Review (Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24):**
   - Review all data collected (quantitative + qualitative)
   - Identify: What's working? What's not? What's unclear?
   - Generate hypotheses: Why are we seeing these results?
   - Decide: What should we change?

2. **Rapid Cycle Testing:**
   - When we identify improvement opportunity, test small before scaling
   - Example: If workshops feel too long, pilot 2-hour format with one cohort before changing all workshops
   - Measure impact of change (did shorter format work as well?)

3. **Evidence-Based Adjustments:**
   - Changes must be grounded in data, not just opinions
   - Example: Don't change training curriculum because one person complained; wait for pattern in feedback

4. **Stakeholder Co-Creation:**
   - Involve managers and employees in designing improvements
   - Example: "You said 1-on-1s are awkward. What would make them feel more natural?" → Managers co-create solutions

**Adjustment Mechanisms:**

- **Training Content:** Update curriculum based on what managers struggle with most (e.g., if feedback delivery is hardest skill, add more practice time)
- **Implementation Approach:** Modify delivery method if not working (e.g., switch from all in-person to hybrid if scheduling is barrier)
- **Support Structures:** Add resources based on needs (e.g., if managers want 1-on-1 templates, create library)
- **Measurement:** Refine surveys based on response patterns (e.g., if questions are confusing, reword)

### Knowledge Management

**Documentation Strategy:**

1. **Program Wiki/SharePoint:** Central repository for all program materials
   - Training curriculum and materials
   - Manager resource library (templates, guides, best practices)
   - Evaluation reports and data
   - Lessons learned document (updated quarterly)

2. **Case Study Development:** Write up program as case study for internal and external sharing
   - Problem definition
   - Evidence-based solution design
   - Implementation approach
   - Results and lessons learned

3. **Video Library:** Record manager success stories, training highlights, employee testimonials

**Knowledge Sharing:**

1. **Internal Sharing:**
   - HR team: Share learnings in HR meetings, build organizational memory
   - Other departments: Offer to help other teams implement similar evidence-based approaches
   - New managers: Include program in new manager onboarding (perpetuate culture)

2. **External Sharing:**
   - Professional conferences: Present at SHRM, Academy of Management
   - Academic partnerships: Partner with university for case study or research publication
   - Peer organizations: Share with other companies facing similar retention challenges
   - Industry publications: Write article for HR Magazine, Harvard Business Review

### Sustainability Assessment

**Long-term Viability Evaluation (Month 18 and 24):**

1. **Financial Sustainability:**
   - Are costs declining as planned? (target: $100-160K/year by Month 24)
   - Is ROI positive and sustained? (target: 200%+ ongoing)
   - Can organization afford ongoing investment?

2. **Cultural Sustainability:**
   - Is manager capability becoming "how we do things"? (embedded in systems)
   - Do new managers adopt practices without formal training? (cultural transmission)
   - Is there ongoing demand/support for program?

3. **Resource Sustainability:**
   - Can internal facilitators sustain without external consultant? (target: yes by Month 24)
   - Is HR program manager role sustainable long-term?
   - Are tools and resources self-service? (low maintenance)

4. **Results Sustainability:**
   - Are retention gains holding or fading?
   - Are manager skills holding or deteriorating?
   - Do we need ongoing reinforcement or has it become habit?

**Adaptation Planning (Ongoing):**

**Scenario 1: Program Works But Costs Too Much**
- **Adaptation:** Shift to lower-cost delivery (internal facilitators, digital resources, peer learning)
- **Trade-off:** May lose some quality but preserve impact at sustainable cost

**Scenario 2: Program Works for Some Managers/Teams But Not Others**
- **Adaptation:** Segment approach - intensive support for struggling managers, light touch for successful managers
- **Trade-off:** Complexity increases but resources focused where needed most

**Scenario 3: Retention Improves But Manager Skills Decline**
- **Adaptation:** Add accountability mechanisms (manager effectiveness in performance reviews, poor performers face consequences)
- **Trade-off:** May create resistance but ensures sustained behavior change

**Scenario 4: External Conditions Change (e.g., Labor Market Loosens)**
- **Adaptation:** Dial back compensation competitiveness (save money), maintain manager development (core capability)
- **Trade-off:** Accept some retention slippage if labor market makes retention easier

**Long-Term Vision:** By Month 36-48, program should be fully institutionalized, low-cost, high-impact, and self-sustaining. Manager capability is organizational DNA, not an HR program.

## Evaluation Summary

This assessment plan provides systematic, rigorous approach to determining whether the Retention Acceleration Program achieves its goals. The plan balances:

- **Rigor:** Quasi-experimental design, multiple data sources, statistical analysis
- **Practicality:** Uses existing systems where possible, manageable data collection burden
- **Learning:** Formative evaluation allows mid-course corrections, not just summative judgment
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Multiple feedback mechanisms ensure voices are heard
- **Transparency:** Regular reporting keeps all stakeholders informed

**Critical Success Factor:** We must actually USE the evaluation data to make decisions. Collecting data without acting on findings wastes time and money. The quarterly review cycles ensure we're constantly learning and improving, not just measuring for measurement's sake.

**Logic Model Validation:** By measuring both mediators (job satisfaction, manager quality, career growth perception) and outcomes (retention), we can test whether our theory of change is correct. If retention improves WITHOUT mediator improvements, we know something else is driving retention (not our intervention). If mediators improve BUT retention doesn't, we know our theory is wrong (manager quality might not cause retention in our context).

This evaluation is more than accountability - it's organizational learning and capability building.
