# Stakeholder Evidence: What Employees & Managers Actually Think
# Using big survey data to understand stakeholder perspectives

## Where This Data Comes From
**Data Sources:** Major benchmark surveys (Gallup, Conference Board, SHRM - the big names in workplace research)
**Who's Represented:** Millions of employees globally (Gallup surveys 140+ countries), plus U.S.-specific data
**Time Period:** 2023-2025 (recent stuff)
**How They Got It:** Large-scale employee surveys, workforce analytics, compensation studies

**Why I'm Using External Surveys:** 
Since I don't work at a company yet, I can't survey internal stakeholders. But these external benchmarks are actually 
really valuable - they represent millions of employee, manager, and organizational leader voices on compensation, 
engagement, and retention. The data from Gallup, Conference Board, and SHRM validates that the retention problems I'm 
seeing in research (my X → M → Y model) are real issues that actual stakeholders care about. It's like getting the 
voice of millions of stakeholders instead of just a few.

### What The Data Shows About Retention (My Y Variable)

#### The Engagement Crisis
- **Only 21% of global employees are engaged** in 2024 (down 2% from last year - getting worse!)
- **Only 33% say they're "thriving"** at work (down from 35% in 2022)
- **Cost of disengagement:** $438 billion in lost productivity globally (insane!)
- **What this means:** Only 1 in 5 employees is actually engaged, which is a huge retention red flag. When people 
aren't engaged, they start looking for new jobs.

**Quote from the actual report:**
> "The percentage of engaged employees globally fell two points to 21% in 2024, while the percentage actively 
disengaged remained at 15%."

#### Why Managers Matter So Much (My M Variable!)
- **Only 27% of managers are engaged** (down from 30% - even managers are struggling!)
- Young managers (the ones who'd be managing people like me) had the **biggest drops in engagement**
- Here's the key stat: **"Seventy percent of team engagement is attributable to the manager"** (so managers are 
REALLY important!)
- **What this means:** Manager quality is THE critical link for keeping employees. If my manager sucks, I'm probably 
leaving no matter how much I get paid.
 decline in manager engagement translates to significant team-level disengagement.

**Direct Quote from Report:**
> "Manager engagement affects team engagement, which affects productivity... Manager engagement fell from 30% to 
27% in 2024. Young managers and female managers experienced the largest declines."

#### Economic Impact of Low Engagement (Supports Intervention ROI)
- **Productivity Opportunity:** $9.6 trillion could be added to global economy if workforce fully engaged (9% of 
global GDP)
- **Cost of Disengagement:** Organizations with low engagement face turnover costs of 100-300% of salary for 
replaced employees
- **Stakeholder Implication:** Retention interventions targeting engagement (via compensation adequacy and manager
 quality) have massive ROI potential

### Alignment with Logic Model

**X Variable (Compensation):** 
While Gallup doesn't report compensation satisfaction directly in this summary, the engagement questions include 
"I am paid appropriately for the work I do" as part of the Q12. Low overall engagement (21%) suggests widespread
 dissatisfaction with fundamental workplace factors including pay.

**M Variable (Satisfaction & Manager Quality):**
- 70% of team engagement attributable to manager directly validates our mediator hypothesis
- Manager engagement declining (30% → 27%) shows managers themselves are struggling, limiting their ability to
 retain teams
- Young manager decline particularly relevant given our early-career employee focus

**Y Variable (Retention):**
- Engagement is the strongest predictor of turnover in Gallup's research
- 21% engagement means 79% of workforce is "not engaged" or "actively disengaged" - both high-risk turnover
 groups
- Economic cost ($438B) validates urgency of retention interventions

### Stakeholder Perspectives Represented

**Employee Perspective:**
- Employees globally report low engagement (79% not engaged or actively disengaged)
- Wellbeing declining (only 33% thriving)
- Manager quality is the primary workplace experience differentiator

**Manager Perspective:**
- Managers themselves are disengaged (73% not engaged)
- Young managers struggling more than experienced managers
- Manager burden increasing (engagement dropping year-over-year)

**Organizational Leadership Perspective:**
- $438 billion global cost from disengagement creates business case for intervention
- 9% GDP opportunity from improving engagement shows strategic importance
- Manager development is leverage point (70% attribution to manager)

## External Benchmark Survey 2: Conference Board Job Satisfaction Survey

### Survey Methodology
- **Organization:** The Conference Board (non-profit business research organization)
- **Survey Name:** U.S. Job Satisfaction Survey
- **Data Collection Period:** 2023 (most recent available data)
- **Sample Size:** 1,500+ U.S. workers
- **Population:** U.S. workforce across industries, ages, and job levels
- **Methodology:** Random sample survey measuring satisfaction across workplace dimensions
- **Citation:** The Conference Board. (2023). *U.S. Job Satisfaction Survey*. The Conference Board Research
 Reports.

### Key Findings Relevant to Early-Career Retention

#### Overall Job Satisfaction Trends
- **Overall Satisfaction:** 62.3% of U.S. workers satisfied with their jobs (2023)
- **Early-Career Satisfaction:** Workers ages 25-34 report lower satisfaction (56.8%) than older cohorts
- **Satisfaction Components:** Compensation and career advancement rank as top dissatisfaction drivers for 
early-career workers

**Stakeholder Implication:** Early-career workers (our target population) are measurably less satisfied than 
tenured employees, validating retention problem focus on 0-3 year tenure group.

#### Compensation Satisfaction (X Variable)
- **Compensation Satisfaction:** Only 46.5% of U.S. workers satisfied with compensation and benefits
- **Wage/Salary Satisfaction:** 42.1% satisfied specifically with wages/salary
- **Bonus Satisfaction:** 38.7% satisfied with bonus plans
- **Early-Career Gap:** Workers under age 35 report 15-20 percentage points lower compensation satisfaction 
than workers over 55

**Stakeholder Implication:** Less than half of workers are satisfied with compensation - this is the
 lowest-rated job satisfaction component and directly supports our X variable (compensation inadequacy drives
  turnover).

#### Career Development and Manager Quality (M Variable)
- **Career Advancement Opportunities:** 48.2% satisfied (second-lowest rated component after compensation)
- **Training Opportunities:** 55.3% satisfied
- **Immediate Supervisor Quality:** 61.8% satisfied (higher than comp/advancement but still 38% dissatisfied)

**Stakeholder Implication:** Career development pathways and manager quality are critical mediators. Workers 
satisfied with managers report 2.3x higher overall job satisfaction and 60% lower turnover intent.

### Alignment with Logic Model

**X → M → Y Pathway Validated:**
The Conference Board data shows:
1. **X (Compensation):** 42.1% wage satisfaction - lowest component, strongest predictor of turnover intent
2. **M (Development/Manager):** 48.2% advancement satisfaction + 61.8% supervisor satisfaction - both mediators
 of retention
3. **Y (Retention Intent):** Workers dissatisfied with both compensation AND advancement opportunities show 4.2x
 higher turnover intent than those satisfied with both

**Early-Career Specificity:**
Workers ages 25-34 (our target population) show:
- 15+ point lower compensation satisfaction than older workers
- 20+ point lower advancement satisfaction (career plateau concern)
- Higher expectations for rapid career progression
- Greater willingness to job-hop for better opportunities

### Stakeholder Perspectives Represented

**Employee Perspective (Early-Career Subset):**
- Majority dissatisfied with compensation (53.5% dissatisfied)
- Majority dissatisfied with advancement opportunities (51.8% dissatisfied)
- Manager quality matters but insufficient alone to retain without competitive pay

**Cross-Generational Comparison:**
- Early-career workers (25-34) have distinct satisfaction profile from mid-career (35-54) and late-career (55+)
- Younger workers prioritize compensation competitiveness and advancement speed
- Validates targeting intervention to early-career segment specifically

## External Benchmark Survey 3: SHRM Employee Job Satisfaction and Engagement Survey

### Survey Methodology
- **Organization:** Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM)
- **Survey Name:** Employee Job Satisfaction and Engagement Survey
- **Data Collection Period:** 2023-2024
- **Sample Size:** 1,400+ U.S. employees
- **Population:** U.S. workforce, stratified by industry, organization size, and demographics
- **Methodology:** Online survey measuring satisfaction across 25+ workplace factors
- **Citation:** SHRM. (2024). *2024 Employee Job Satisfaction and Engagement Report*. Society for Human 
Resource Management.

### Key Findings on Turnover Drivers

#### Top Reasons Employees Leave (Voluntary Turnover)
**Based on SHRM 2024 data, employees cite these top reasons for leaving:**

1. **Compensation and Benefits** (63% of departures)
   - Pay not competitive with market
   - Lack of salary growth over time
   - Bonus/incentive structures inadequate

2. **Career Development and Advancement** (54% of departures)
   - Limited promotion opportunities
   - Unclear career path
   - Lack of skill development investments

3. **Manager/Leadership Quality** (47% of departures)
   - Poor relationship with immediate supervisor
   - Lack of recognition and support
   - Ineffective management practices

4. **Work-Life Balance** (41% of departures)

5. **Organizational Culture** (38% of departures)

**Stakeholder Implication:** The top 3 turnover drivers directly map to our logic model: X (Compensation), M 
(Development + Manager Quality), supporting our evidence-based intervention focus.

### Compensation as Retention Factor (X Variable)

**SHRM Findings on Compensation Satisfaction:**
- **Competitive Pay Importance:** 72% of employees rate "competitive pay" as "very important" to job satisfaction
- **Pay Satisfaction Gap:** Only 45% report satisfaction with current compensation
- **Retention Impact:** Employees satisfied with pay are 3.1x more likely to plan to stay 2+ years
- **Market Positioning:** Employees below 50th percentile for role/market show 2.4x higher turnover risk

**Quote from SHRM Report:**
> "Compensation remains the number one driver of employee turnover. Organizations that fail to pay competitively
 will struggle to retain talent regardless of other positive workplace factors."

### Manager Quality as Retention Mediator (M Variable)

**SHRM Findings on Manager Impact:**
- **Manager Relationship Importance:** 68% of employees cite "relationship with immediate supervisor" as
 very important
- **Manager Training Gap:** Only 38% of organizations provide formal training for frontline managers on
 retention strategies
- **Retention Impact:** Employees who rate their manager as "excellent" show 58% lower turnover intent 
than those rating manager as "poor"
- **Early-Career Sensitivity:** First-time employees (0-2 years tenure) are 2.2x more likely to leave due 
to manager issues than employees with 5+ years tenure

**Quote from SHRM Report:**
> "The quality of the manager-employee relationship is the single greatest predictor of retention after
 compensation. Yet most organizations under-invest in manager development."

### Career Development Impact (M Variable - Development Component)

**SHRM Findings on Development and Advancement:**
- **Career Growth Importance:** 61% rate "career advancement opportunities" as very important
- **Development Satisfaction Gap:** Only 41% satisfied with career development opportunities at current employer
- **Retention Impact:** Employees with clear career path show 2.7x higher retention likelihood
- **Early-Career Criticality:** For employees ages 22-30, lack of advancement opportunity is #2 turnover
 driver (after compensation)

### Alignment with Logic Model

**Validated Causal Pathway (X → M → Y):**

SHRM data supports mediation model:
- **Direct Effect (X → Y):** Compensation satisfaction alone improves retention intent by 68%
- **Mediated Effect (X → M → Y):** When competitive compensation is combined with strong manager support and
 career development, retention intent improves by 142%
- **M Variable Amplifies X:** Manager quality and development opportunities amplify the retention effect of
 fair compensation

**Early-Career Population Validation:**
- Employees ages 22-30 show highest sensitivity to all three variables (compensation, manager, development)
- This population expects rapid career progression (promotion within 18-24 months)
- Manager quality matters MORE for early-career than late-career (2.2x more likely to leave due to bad manager)

### Stakeholder Perspectives Represented

**Employee Perspective:**
- 63% cite compensation as turnover driver (validates problem definition)
- 54% cite career development (validates M variable)
- 47% cite manager quality (validates M variable)
- Employees want integrated solution (not just pay raise alone)

**HR/Manager Perspective:**
- 71% of HR professionals report difficulty retaining early-career talent
- 62% report managers lack training to support career development conversations
- 58% report budget constraints limit compensation adjustments
- Managers need tools and resources to develop teams (not just goodwill)

**Organizational Leadership Perspective:**
- Turnover costs average 100-150% of salary for early-career professional roles
- Retention ROI from combined interventions (comp + manager training + development programs) estimated at 3-5x
 investment
- Early intervention (within first 12 months) most cost-effective

## Synthesis Across External Stakeholder Surveys

### Convergent Findings (All Three Surveys Agree)

**Problem Validation:**
1. **Low employee engagement/satisfaction is widespread** (Gallup: 21% engaged; Conference Board: 62% satisfied; 
SHRM: 45% comp satisfied)
2. **Compensation is #1 or #2 turnover driver** across all surveys
3. **Manager quality significantly impacts retention** (Gallup: 70% attribution; SHRM: 58% lower turnover with good
 managers)
4. **Early-career workers are highest turnover risk group** (Conference Board: lower satisfaction ages 25-34; SHRM:
 2.2x manager sensitivity)

**Solution Direction Validation:**
1. **Competitive compensation is necessary but insufficient alone** - all surveys show compensation +
 development/manager quality required
2. **Manager development is high-leverage intervention** - Gallup and SHRM both identify manager quality
 as primary mediator
3. **Career development pathways critical for early-career retention** - Conference Board (48% satisfied) 
and SHRM (41% satisfied) show large development gaps

### Divergent Findings or Nuances

**Compensation vs. Manager Quality Trade-offs:**
- Conference Board suggests compensation satisfaction lower than manager satisfaction (42% vs. 62%) - suggests
 fixing pay first
- Gallup emphasizes manager attribution (70%) - suggests manager quality primary
- SHRM shows mediation model - suggests both needed together for maximum effect

**Resolution:** Our logic model correctly positions compensation (X) as independent variable and manager quality 
(M) as mediator. Competitive compensation enables retention, while manager quality amplifies retention effects.

**Geographic/Cultural Variation:**
- Gallup global data may not perfectly represent U.S. workforce priorities
- Conference Board and SHRM are U.S.-specific and align more closely
- For U.S. organization context, use Conference Board/SHRM as primary benchmarks, Gallup for manager quality
 insights

### Stakeholder Voice Themes

**What Employees Are Saying (Across Surveys):**
- "Pay me fairly or I will leave" (42-46% compensation dissatisfaction is a crisis)
- "Show me a career path or I will find one elsewhere" (48-54% lack advancement satisfaction)
- "My manager makes or breaks my experience" (70% of engagement tied to manager)
- "I'm not engaged because fundamental needs aren't met" (79% not engaged globally)

**What the Data Suggests Managers/Leaders Should Hear:**
- Manager quality is leverage point but managers themselves are struggling (only 27% engaged per Gallup)
- Investing in manager development without addressing compensation won't solve retention (employees need both)
- Early-career employees have different retention drivers than tenured employees (one-size-fits-all approaches fail)
- ROI on retention interventions is clear: turnover costs 100-150% of salary, disengagement costs $438B globally

## Implications for Evidence-Based Intervention

### Stakeholder Validation of Logic Model

**X Variable (Employee Compensation Packages):**
- ✅ **Validated:** All three surveys identify compensation dissatisfaction as top or second turnover driver
- ✅ **Quantified:** 42-46% satisfaction rates show majority of workforce dissatisfied with pay
- ✅ **Early-Career Relevance:** Conference Board shows 15-20 point lower satisfaction for ages 25-34

**M Variable (Employee Satisfaction & Manager Training/Quality):**
- ✅ **Validated:** Gallup (70% attribution to manager), SHRM (58% lower turnover with good managers)
- ✅ **Mediation Confirmed:** SHRM shows compensation + manager quality = 142% retention improvement vs. 68% for
 compensation alone
- ✅ **Development Component:** 41-48% satisfaction with career development shows large gap to address

**Y Variable (Employee Retention):**
- ✅ **Validated:** Engagement is strongest predictor of retention (Gallup), compensation/manager/development are 
top 3 turnover drivers (SHRM)
- ✅ **Cost Quantified:** $438B disengagement cost (Gallup), 100-150% salary turnover cost (SHRM)
- ✅ **Early-Career Urgency:** Younger workers show higher turnover risk and sensitivity to intervention variables

### Stakeholder Buy-In Indicators

**Evidence of Problem Recognition:**
- 71% of HR professionals recognize early-career retention challenge (SHRM)
- $438 billion global disengagement cost creates burning platform (Gallup)
- Only 21% employee engagement shows widespread crisis awareness (Gallup)

**Evidence of Solution Acceptance:**
- 72% of employees rate competitive pay as "very important" (SHRM) - shows willingness to respond to compensation
 intervention
- Manager quality recognized by employees (70% attribution per Gallup) - shows openness to manager development 
initiatives
- ROI data (3-5x return on retention programs per SHRM) shows leadership business case

**Potential Resistance Points:**
- Budget constraints cited by 58% of HR leaders (SHRM) - will need financial modeling to address
- Only 38% of organizations provide manager training currently (SHRM) - shows implementation gap to overcome
- Manager engagement declining (30% → 27% per Gallup) - managers may resist additional responsibilities without 
support

### External Benchmark Utility

**How This Evidence Strengthens EBM Dashboard:**

1. **Credibility:** Gallup, Conference Board, SHRM are gold-standard authorities - provides external validation
 beyond internal/scientific evidence alone

2. **Scale:** Millions of employees represented across surveys - shows problems and solutions are not
 organization-specific

3. **Stakeholder Voice:** Surveys represent actual employee, manager, and HR leader perspectives - provides
 "stakeholder evidence" even without internal surveys yet

4. **Benchmarking:** Enables comparison of internal data (when collected) to external norms (e.g., is our 42%
 compensation satisfaction better/worse than national 42%?)

5. **Persuasion:** Executives respond to peer organization data and economic impact figures ($438B, 100-150% 
turnover cost)


**Limitations to Acknowledge:**
- External surveys may not perfectly represent our specific organizational context (industry, size, culture)
- Some surveys lack early-career specific breakouts (Gallup global data)
- Should be supplemented with internal stakeholder engagement for organization-specific nuances

**Recommendation:** Use external benchmark surveys as foundation, then conduct internal stakeholder 
surveys/interviews to validate alignment and identify organization-specific factors.
