## X → Y Framework
### Current State 
Top-performing early-career employees often leave within 2–3 years due to limited 
career development opportunities, lack of mentorship, unclear growth paths, and weak 
connection to organizational purpose. This results in high turnover and loss of promising talent.
### Desired State 
Retain high-potential early-career employees by providing career development, 
mentorship, recognition, and a strong sense of belonging—ensuring they see a 
clear future in the organization.

## PICOC Framework
### Population 
Early-career employees (0–5 years of experience)

Direct managers who must train and replace lost employees

HR and leadership responsible for workforce planning

### Intervention 
Structured mentorship and coaching programs

Clear career progression pathways

Regular feedback and recognition systems

Opportunities for skill development and challenging projects

Stronger communication channels between management and early-career staff

### Comparison 
Maintain the status quo (continue to lose talent and rehire frequently)

Focus retention efforts only on mid-career or senior employees

Rely on financial incentives alone rather than holistic development strategies

### Outcomes 
Reduced turnover rate among early-career employees (e.g., retention >80% after 3 years)

Higher employee engagement and satisfaction scores

Increased internal promotion rates from early-career to mid-level roles

Stronger employer brand and recruitment appeal

### Context 
Organizational context: medium-to-large companies competing for skilled talent

Geographic context: primarily in competitive job markets ( North America, Europe, Asia)

Temporal context: critical during the first 2–3 years of employment when turnover risk is highest

## Poor communication between upper-level management and lower-level employees results in 
misunderstandings, low engagement, and misalignment of organizational goals.

Poor retention of top early-career talent caused by limited career development, 
weak communication, and lack of recognition results in high turnover, loss of 
future leaders, and increased recruitment/training costs.

## Why This Problem Matters
### Impact on Organization
Higher costs from recruiting and onboarding replacements

Loss of institutional knowledge and leadership pipeline

Slower innovation and productivity from constant turnover

### Stakeholder Impact
Employees: feel undervalued and leave for better opportunities

Managers: face repeated training burdens and gaps in team capability

HR/Leadership: struggle to maintain workforce stability and talent pipelines

### Strategic Alignment
Retaining early-career talent supports long-term organizational growth

Aligns with goals around innovation, succession planning, and cost management

Builds a strong culture of employee development and loyalty

## Evidence Questions to Explore
### For the Problem (Step 2)
What is our current early-career turnover rate compared to industry benchmarks?

What feedback do exit interviews provide about why employees leave?

Are certain departments/roles experiencing higher attrition than others?

### For the Solution (Step 4)
What evidence shows mentorship and career development improve retention?

Which organizations have successfully implemented retention strategies for 
early-career talent?

What risks (e.g., cost, management bandwidth) are associated with these 
interventions, and how can they be mitigated?
